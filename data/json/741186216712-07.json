We actively participate in this community-oriented development process, often in a leadership role, and leverage it to create our Red Hat- and JBoss-branded enterprise technologies. \n  \nWe believe that the open source development and licensing model offers advantages for Red Hat and our customers over proprietary software development and licensing models. Through the open source development model, we leverage a global community of developers and users, whose collective resources and knowledge supplement the developers we employ. As a result, we believe we are able to offer enhancements, fixes and upgrades more quickly and with less development cost than is typical of many proprietary software vendors. In turn, our customers are able to take advantage of the quality and value of open source software, which we help develop, aggregate, integrate, test, certify, deliver, maintain and support for their enterprise use.", "industry_forums": "", "head_office_phone": "(+353)212303400", "level_of_interest": "global", "relevant_communication": "Against lock-in: building open ICT systems by making better use of standards in public procurement (https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/open-standards) and subsequent EU initiatives such as ICT standardisation priorities for the Digital Single Market (https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/standards-digitising-european-industry)  - key to \"Digitising European Industry\" objective.", "financial_year_end_date": "01/02/2018", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "300000-399999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "0", "legal_status": "Corporation", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "James Lovegrove", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "EMEA Public Policy Director"}
