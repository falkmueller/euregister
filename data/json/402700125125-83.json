Today we count more than 100 members. In a world of increasing internationalism, legislation, environment, the media and trade are all now multinational by nature. The combined strength of our members, and a close cooperation with national outdoor associations, provides us with an extremely powerful force to represent the European outdoor industry in a constructive and positive manner. \n \nThe EOG strongly believes that increased participation in outdoor sports will benefit both individuals and society as a whole.  We share a vision with many others in our industry, to encourage people of all ages and in all locations to be active outdoors.", "industry_forums": "", "head_office_phone": "(+44)1539727255", "level_of_interest": "European", "relevant_communication": "- European Week of Sports \n- FESI IPR Committee (Operation Copycat) \n- DEMETO Project (H2020) \n- BOSS Project (Erasmus+)", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2016", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "800000-899999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "0", "legal_status": "Association", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Arne Strate", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "Head of Marketing and Communications"}
