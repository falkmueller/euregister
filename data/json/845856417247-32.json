Composed of 42 members, most of which are European insect producing companies, IPIFF promotes the use of insects & insect derived products as top tier source of nutrients for human consumption & animal feed.  \n \nIPIFF main mission is to promote the wider use of insects as an alternative or new source of protein for human consumption & animal feed through continuous dialogue with EU decision makers (i.e. European Commission, EU Member States authorities, European Parliament & European Food Safety Authority). Notably, IPIFF centres its activities around advocating for appropriate EU legislative frameworks to apply to insect production.  \n \nThe association also supports its members in the effective implementation of EU food & feed safety legislations, such as through the promotion and/or development of shared standards.  \n \nMore generally, IPIFF aims to communicate on the benefits of eating insects and/or their use as animal feed towards the wider public.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+32)743 29 97"}
