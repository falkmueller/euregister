Our goal is to foster a free market environment which encourages the people of Lithuania to pursue their own objectives in a way that is constructive to the society\u2019s common interests and not through relying on the government. We believe the best way to assist the accomplishment of these common interests is without any privileges, protection or restrictions imposed upon particular individuals. \n \nThe LFMI\u2018s team conducts research on key economic and policy issues, develops conceptual reform packages, drafts and evaluates legislative proposals, and aids Lithuanian government institutions by advising them on how to better implement free market principles. LFMI also conducts sociological surveys, issues economic literature and organizes conferences, workshops, and lectures. Educational activities are an integral component of LFMI\u2018s work and are aimed at making free market ideas an integral part of Lithuanian society.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+370)5 250 0280"}
