The trade in unregulated and untested counterfeit goods poses a significant danger to consumers\u2019 health, and costs governments around the world untold billions in lost revenues \u2013 funds that could be used to build schools, provide healthcare, and cut taxes. \n \nWe established CAIT to foster enhanced co-operation among stakeholders, share best practice, and discuss practical solutions to the problem. Industry involvement is vital, given its hard-won insights into markets, supply chains and effective control processes. Our members have significant experience in implementing track & trace systems and authentication solutions. With CAIT, we have created a forum dedicated to advancing common technological standards \u2013 and to stepping up the fight against illicit trade worldwide. \n \nOur Mission \n \n- Encourage collaboration and exchange best practice between industry, regulators and policymakers \n- Promote open technology standards to develop effective solutions in the fight against counterfeiting and illicit trade \n- Deepen our understanding of track & trace and anti-counterfeiting technologies and their practical application \n \nMembership is open to all companies and organisations who share the coalition\u2019s objectives and principles.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+32)2 737 92 00"}
