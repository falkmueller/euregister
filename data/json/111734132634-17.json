By building upon shared values rather than partisan divides, and empowering our supporters to work in keeping with the concerns of their local communities, we work towards the adoption of fair, effective, and sustainable climate change solutions. \n \nIn order to generate the political will necessary for adoption of our Carbon Fee and Dividend proposal we train and support volunteers to build relationships with elected officials, the media and their local community. \n \nIn particular we have developed Carbon Pricing policy that works for the environment, supports the economy and protects the most vulnerable in society (the poorest 65%). The policy scales globally and can be deployed by individual nations or by cooperating trading blocks. \n \nConsequently our remit is to lobby nationally via the most practical route possible and internationally via appropriate bodies such as the UNFCCC, Carbon Pricing Leadership Coalition and now the EU. \n \nEach country team of volunteers develops its own national strategy with support from the International community. As more groups form within the EU countries, the EU legal and trade rules necessitates engagement with the EU to permit and support the most effective policies.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+1)6194377142"}
