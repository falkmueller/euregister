We blend advances in technology and emerging collaborative approaches to re-invent existing institutions and processes of governance to improve people\u2019s lives. We strive to fill the gap between academic thinking and reality by creating synergies between scholars and policymakers to engage underrepresented citizens, civil society\u2019s organizations and lobby in the public interest. \n \nAbout The Good Lobby -- The Good Lobby, which is an initiative of eLabEurope, is a platform for bringing together NGOs, academics and professionals in the EU to combine the their skills and passions and lobby for the public interest. \n \nIn contemporary Europe, a civic empowerment gap is emerging. Political power is increasingly distributed unequally between citizens, particularly in relation to EU policymaking, where business interest groups are strong and civil society is weak. To address this problem, The Good Lobby wants to connect people with expertise and knowledge with civil society organizations that need them. \n \nDrawing on the concept of sharing economy, The Good Lobby intends to exploit the untapped potential of ordinary citizens, such as academics, professionals and students, to help non-profits discharging their mission. To do so, it will create a network of professionals across different disciplines like lawyers, communication strategists and IT consultants to support civil society organizations in need of professional services. Non-profit organizations lacking economic means and/or expertise will receive pro bono or low bono integrated legal advice, communication strategy plans and research.", "industry_forums": "", "head_office_phone": "(+34)616774456", "level_of_interest": "European, global", "relevant_communication": "The Good Lobby has launched several actions to instil a culture of pro bono in the EU space and further build and develop the community of EU pro bono actors and supporters:  \n \n\u2022    The European Pro Bono Masterclass:\u00a0This half-day training offered across Europe aims at instilling a culture of pro bono in a new generation of EU public interest advocates.
