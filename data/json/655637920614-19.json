Our mission is to remain one of the safest motorways in Europe and to achieve this, we invest a lot of time and effort in road safety, by ensuring that the motorway is well-maintained, that traffic is kept moving and that incidents that may occur on the motorway are quickly dealt with.  \nIn addition to our efforts on the road, we strongly believe that educated drivers make the difference in road safety, and hence, investing in educating people on road safety has become a major strategy for Attica Tollway. And as road safety education should start from a young age, to set a good basis for future behaviour, children and adolescents are targeted in most of the company's road education programs.", "industry_forums": "", "inter_groups": "", "number_of_persons_involved": "6", "relevant_communication": "Attikes Diadromes runs several annual campaigns on road safety, targeting car and motorcycle drivers, passengers and children, were launched.

These programs are \"Little Atticus\" - an interactive theatrical playabout Road Safety- and the educational program \"Eyes on the Road\". For these two programs, Attikes Diadromes S.A. was awarded the prestigious \"Excellence in Road Safety Award\" by the European Commission, which was presented at a special ceremony in February 2015 in Brussels, Belgium.", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2016", "lat": 37.9611682, "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "25000-49999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "0", "legal_status": "SA", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "VASILEIOS CHALKIAS", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "MANAGING DIRECTOR", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+30)2106682000"}
