IFISO provides a platform for these NGOs to share best practices, but also to pursue common aims, often by cooperating through inter-organisational projects on a European level. \n \nThe five organisations with which BEST cooperates the most are our Official Partners: bonding from Germany, CFES (Canadian Federation of Engineering Students) from Canada, (Association des Etats G\u00e9n\u00e9raux des Etudiants de l'Europe / European Students' Forum) from Europe, ESTIEM (European Students of Industrial Engineering and Management).

Therefore we create opportunities for the students to meet and learn from one another through our academic and non-academic events and educational symposium. \"Learning makes the master\", but the final goal is a good working place, therefore we offer services like an international career center to broaden the horizons for the choice on the job market. \n \nOur priority is to offer high quality services for students all over Europe.
