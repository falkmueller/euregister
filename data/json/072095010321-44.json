Its mission is to encourage environmental, social and economic growth of inner rural regions, through innovative business initiatives.  \nThe organisation aims to develop and apply technical-scientific knowledge to problems and opportunities related to territory exploitation helping in the creation of new businesses, based on regional bioeconomy. To achieve this, BLC3 develops market-oriented R&D projects, based on scientific areas such as bioeconomy (leads a consortium of five European countries for the development of \u201cbioregions\u201d and bioeconomy from five different regions), biotechnology (developing 2nd and 3rd generation biorefineries energetically self-sufficient), sustainability (developing new criteria and systems for the sustainable use of the territory, based on sustainable life cycle assessments), mycology (with the Centre of Applied Mycology), and also areas dedicated to the mitigation of forest fires and advanced technologies to treat and valorise wastewaters/effluents.  \nBLC3 possess an infrastructure of around 4 ha and access to a network of researchers (55 R&D entities from nine European countries), supporting the transfer of knowledge and technology between higher education institutions and industry in a targeted and results-oriented manner.
