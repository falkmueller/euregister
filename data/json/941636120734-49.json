Wildlife crime is estimated to be one of largest transnational organized criminal activities in the world alongside trafficking in drugs, arms, and human beings. Wildlife crime is one of the biggest drivers of biodiversity loss and of climate change.  Wildlife crime destabilizes societies, enables the spread of diseases such as Ebola and Zica, fuels corruption and other types of crimes such as money laundering and terrorism.
