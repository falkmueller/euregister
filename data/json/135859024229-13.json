The project sponsor is SPIR. The project organizer is Gemius S.A. \n \nAdMonitoring project: AdMonitoring is based on the goal to provide qualitative shift of the internet advertising monitoring boundaries and contribute to the positive perception of the internet as an important part of the media advertising mix. It follows the advertising power of display ads emited on selected Media. The main types of monitored ads include display, flash, text and combined ads. \n \nAdAudit project: The project serves for analysis of online banner campaigns. It provides information about the number and sociodemographic profile of the people (unique visitors) who came into contact with a campaign (see, interact or click) and it is thus possible to compare a campaign plan with the real reach in a given target group. AdAudit does not include information about the number of ad impressions but can be a proper supplement. \n \nSelf-Regulation: Self-regulatory Committee dealt primarily with issues of using of content (text, audio, video records, respectively audiovisual content). Since April 2016, its scope was extended to personal data protection. It develops and recommends standards and standards of conduct, provides a clear interpretation of the legislative restrictions and defines best practices.
