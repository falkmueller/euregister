PLATFORMA was officially launched on the occasion of the 2008 European Development Days in Strasbourg. The platform is co-financed by the Commission since 2009. \n  \nCoordinating the voice of European local and regional authorities with the European institutions, PLATFORMA has three major objectives:  \n- increased political recognition of the activities of local and regional authorities in development cooperation; \n- in-depth dialogue between local and regional authorities and the European institutions in charge of development policies; \n- promotion of effective decentralised cooperation for the development of partner territories, especially in partnership with civil society. \n  \nThirty-four partners gathered around this ambitious project. Since its creation, the PLATFORMA Secretariat is hosted by the Council of European Municipalities and Regions. \n  \nCONTRIBUTING TO THE DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION AND LOCAL AND REGIONAL AUTHORITIES IN PARTNER COUNTRIES \n  \nStarting April 2012, PLATFORMA has a new grant from the European Commission and opened an office in Brussels, also hosted by the Council of European Municipalities and Regions. This grant finances the organisation of seminars in developing countries, with the purpose of gathering the recommendations of local and regional authorities in partner countries on the EU development cooperation policy. \n  \nThrough the organisation of such events and through the active commitment of its partners, the platform hopes to render more dynamic the already existing links between local and regional authorities of the same continent. Moreover, the creation of an experts\u2019 network from the North and from the South should allow to better match the needs of local and regional authorities in partner countries and the available expertise.   \n  \nThe institutionalisation, at regional level, of a dialogue between local and regional authorities in partner countries and the European institutions is one of the results of the Structured Dialogue. The fact that PLATFORMA was entrusted with such a task shows the recognition of the work done by the network since 2009.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+32)028426777"}
