It is a non-profit foundation funded by the Catalan Government through the Departments of Economy & Knowledge and Health, the Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness, the \"la Caixa\" Banking Foundation, and includes the participation of Pompeu Fabra University. Its mission is to discover and advance knowledge for the benefit of society, public health and \neconomic prosperity. Its goals are the following: \n- To be a world leading centre in biomedical science, by providing our scientists with a stimulating environment, cutting edge technologies and the freedom to conduct the most innovative research. \n- To communicate and establish a dialogue with society, by educating the public and being receptive to their needs. \n- To provide multi- and interdisciplinary training for the next generation of scientists as well as supporting science education. \n- To translate new scientific knowledge into benefits for health and value for society. \nThe CRG believes that the medicine of the future depends on the ground-breaking science of today. This requires an interdisciplinary scientific team focused on understanding the complexity of life from the genome to the cell to a whole organism and its interaction with the environment, offering an integrated view of genetic \ndiseases. \nThe CRG is a unique centre in Spain, based in an innovative organisation research model. Group leaders at the CRG are recruited internationally and receive support from the centre to set up and run their groups. An external Scientific Advisory Board, made up of 13 world leaders in the different areas, evaluates them. The result of evaluations conditions the future of the CRG scientists, no matter whether they have open-ended or time-limited contracts. This ensures the mobility and the renewal of the workforce.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+34)933160100"}
