The Institute was founded in 1882 and was incorporated by Royal Charter in 1891. It represents virtually all the 1900+ registered patent attorneys in the United Kingdom, whether they practise in industry or in private practice. Total membership is over 3300 and includes trainee patent attorneys and other professionals with an interest in intellectual property matters. \n \nThrough its regulatory arm, the Patent Regulation Board, which operates with the Trade Mark Regulation Board as the Intellectual Property Regulation Board (IPReg), the Institute maintains the statutory Register of Patent Attorneys.  IPReg carries out the regulatory functions of setting and maintaining the standards of qualification for entry on the Register and has a Code of Conduct to ensure that registrants provide an appropriate level of service to their clients.   \n \nDespite the historic name of the Institute, patent attorneys have always been qualified to advise on trade marks, designs and copyright as well as patents (collectively known as intellectual property).", "industry_forums": "", "inter_groups": "", "number_of_persons_involved": "4", "relevant_communication": "", "financial_year_end_date": "01/09/2017", "lat": 51.517708, "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "25000-49999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "0", "legal_status": "Incorporated by Royal Charter", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Lee Davies", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "CEO", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+44)207 405 9450"}
