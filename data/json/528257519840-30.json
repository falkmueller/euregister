By doing so, EUROGEO encourages the development of a greater European awareness through the medium of geography and increases mutual knowledge and understanding of Europe. EUROGEO, in affiliation with other organisations, has produced a large number of publications and has organised geography conferences, meetings and workshops on a regular basis. Representatives of professional educational associations have been actively involved in policy making through our work with the Parliamentary Assembly and the Council of Europe. Recent activities include climate change, human rights, Cloud computing, Digital Agenda, new skills, entrepreneurship.  \nEUROGEO also supports those seeking to establish or organise national geography associations and those that promote geography as an academic discipline and geographers in the workplace. It is clear that spatial skills and geographical information on the Web are increasingly important. The roles that geography and geographers play are being challenged by these new geo-opportunities. Those involved with the EUROGEO association are seeking to monitor and support these developments.", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2017", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "183875", "legal_status": "association", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Karl Donert", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "President"}
