As such it represents, promotes and defends the common interests of its 28 member organisations and co-operative banks at large and acts as their representative organ vis-\u00e0-vis the European Union\u2019s institutions and governing bodies. \n \nTo that end and according to its statute,  the association performs among others, the following activities:  \n \n- informs members on the evolution of legislation and regulatory initiatives affecting the sector; \n- provides a platform for members to exchange experiences and points of view and coordinates their positions with regard to common issues; \n- voices the common positions towards the European bodies \n- prepares position papers on issues of common interest \n \nMoreover the EACB is also responsible for: \n- strengthening cooperation between European cooperative banking groups; \n- promoting and developing the cooperative principle in the banking sector at international level and, more generally, in collaboration with other representative cooperative organisations. \n \nCo-operative banks form decentralised networks which are governed by banking as well as co-operative legislation. The co-operative banks business model is based on three pillars: democracy, transparency and proximity. With 58.000 outlets and 3.135 banks, co-operative banks are widely represented throughout the enlarged European Union playing a major role in the financial and economic system. In other words, in Europe one out of two banks is a co-operative. Co-operative banks have a long tradition in serving 209 million customers, mainly consumers, retailers and SMEs. Quantitatively co-operative banks in Europe represent about 80,5 million members, 732,000 employees with a total average market share of about 20%. \n \nFor more info, please visit our website: www.eacb.coop", "industry_forums": "", "head_office_phone": "(+32 2)230 11 24", "level_of_interest": "European", "relevant_communication": "", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2017", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "300000-399999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "0", "legal_status": "International Non-Profit Association (AISBL)", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Herv\u00e9 Guider", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "Managing Director"}
