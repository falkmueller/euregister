Greenpeace aims to protect and conserve nature and to promote peace by investigating, exposing and confronting environmental abuse, challenging the political and economic powers that can effect change, driving economically responsible and socially just solutions that offer hope for current and future generations, and inspire people to take responsibility for the planet. Greenpeace speaks for c.3 million (March 2018 figure) supporters worldwide. \nBased in Brussels, Greenpeace European Unit monitors the work of the EU institutions, exposes deficient EU laws, challenges EU decision-makers to act responsibly in the public interest and confronts industry lobbies that undermine environmental protection in the pursuit of their private interests. \nGreenpeace is committed to transparency about EU interest representation and considers that this register fails basic transparency standards and does not provide EU lobbying transparency. A credible EU lobbying transparency register includes names of individuals and the issues that they try to influence, provides precise and comparable financial information on lobbying, and has effective sanctions to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information disclosed. In an effort to arrive at a more objective way of calculating lobbying expenditures, we follow guidelines that result from consultations with public interest organisations, professionals working on lobby transparency as well as experts of US lobby disclosure legislation (the guidelines developed by the Civil Society Contact Group and ALTER-EU). Our registration therefore provides a more comprehensive calculation of our expenses for their required activities that aim to influence the policy formulation and decision-making processes of the European institutions, and a list of those who, on behalf of Greenpeace, carried out such activities.  \nIn the very limited space this form allows, we aim to give all the relevant information that we consider necessary for lobbying transparency. \nOur registration is based on the guidelines for transparent registration developed by the Civil Society Contact Group and ALTER-EU. The guidelines can be found at http://www.alter-eu.org/sites/default/files/documents/2012_ALTER-EU_CSCG_guidelines_Transparency_Register.pdf", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+32)22741900"}
