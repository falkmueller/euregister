The initiative provides a European platform for exchange and activities to improve early diagnosis and earlier care of HIV across Europe. The initiative is directed by a Steering Committee composed of physicians, researchers, civil society actors, policy-makers of national and European public health institutions. It is increasingly collaborating with the Hepatitis community. \nThe EMERGE project (Evaluating mHealth technology in HIV to improve Empowerment and healthcare utilisation: Research and innovation to Generate Evidence for personalised care) is a mHealth platform to enable self-management of HIV in patients with stable disease.  The platform will provide users with web based and mobile device applications which interface securely with relevant medical data and facilitate remote access to key healthcare providers. EATG will be acting as community partner, supporting standards for HIV care and guidelines for routine monitoring both in the involved countries and more broadly across the EU and potentially wider. \nESTICOM \u2013 EUROPEAN SURVEYS AND TRAININGS TO IMPROVE MSM COMMUNITY HEALTH aims to strengthen the community response and raise awareness about the persisting legal, structural, political and social barriers hindering a more effective response to the syndemics of HIV, hepatitis viruses B and C, and other STI among MSM. The main activities include surveys among MSM (EMIS2017) and Community Based Health Workers (ECHOES) as well as a training programme for Community Health Workers intended to be adaptable for all EU countries. \nHIVACAR \u2013 EVALUATING A COMBINATION OF IMMUNE-BASED THERAPIES TO ACHIEVE A FUNCTIONAL CURE OF HIV INFECTION.

Project aims: To develop a Multidisciplinary Vaccine Platform (MVP) in the fields of prophylactic and therapeutic HIV vaccines. The MVP includes four components: 1) Discovery, 2) Immune Profiling, 3) Data Management, Integration and Down-Selection, and 4) Clinical Trials. \nHAND \u2013 HEPATITIS ACCESS NEEDS. Project aims: To address the specific access needs within co-infected key populations to hepatitis prevention, testing, treatment and care services in Europe (with a special focus on EECA region), and to improve the capacity of key community leaders to further educate and support local community members and improve community involvement in treatment related advocacy and activism. The project has two main components: research and training. The research focuses on the access to hepatitis testing, treatment and care among people in detention and migrants. The training part provides targeted information on treatment and prevention of Hepatitis B and C through webinars in English/Russian and contributes to community mobilization via advocacy-focused workshops, organised in collaboration with local partners.", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2017", "lat": "51.2221055", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "1481395", "legal_status": "NGO", "procurement": "", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "goals__remit": "Founded in 1992, the European AIDS Treatment Group (EATG) is a European network of nationally-based activists.
