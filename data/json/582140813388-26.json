Food safety is an integral part of the EU policy on consumer protection and health. Hygienic and veterinarian conditions are closely monitored and countries exporting food to the EU have to recognize that full compliance with EU laws on food safety is essential. F.E.E.D.M. stands for high quality of honey. Food safety issues are followed up and monitored to make sure that the EU requirements are fully met. F.E.E.D.M. thus aims at the harmonization of trade and of food safety issues to facilitate the trade with honey and to support the cooperation among operators at European level. \n \nIn order to meet these objectives, F.E.E.D.M. engages in the following activities: \n \n- Monitoring and investigation of policy developments in the field of agriculture, food safety, international trade and customs with regards to the EU legislation. \n \n- Maintaining close contacts and exchange with the EU Institutions, competent authorities as well as other stakeholder organizations in the agri-foodstuff sector with the aim to represent and defend the interests of its members. \n \n- Distribution of up to date information to its members on a regular basis. \n \n- Exchange of views and coordination of common positions and activities within F.E.E.D.M. on all subjects of concern for the honey trade. \n \n- Networking platform for its members to meet and exchange views. \n \n- Maintaining Working Groups with regards to scientific developments and exchange of views with scientists on a regular basis. \n \n- Increasing the visibility of the honey sector at European level.", "industry_forums": "", "head_office_phone": "(+49)4037471913", "level_of_interest": "European", "relevant_communication": "", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2016", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "0", "legal_status": "non incorporated association", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Helena Melnikov", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "Secretary General"}
