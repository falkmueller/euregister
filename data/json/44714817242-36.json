Its primary role is as a vehicle for conveying to the Government the views of the churches on legislation and other matters which directly affect them and likewise as a channel through which the Government can consult the churches as a whole on such matters. \"Government\" includes local as well as central Government; Government in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and the EU Commission in Brussels, as well as Westminster/Whitehall; and the CLAS also acts for the churches in their dealings with the major organisations (banks, water and electricity companies, etc) whose activities affect them. From time to time CLAS itself has sponsored legislation on matters of particular interest to it. A secondary, but no less important, function is to provide information on the impact on the churches of legislation and proposals for legislation, and, as appropriate, to act on behalf of churches and ministers of religion in seeking to cure anomalies and bring about a regime that is as fair as possible.", "industry_forums": "", "head_office_phone": "(+44)2072221265", "level_of_interest": "national, regional/local", "relevant_communication": "", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2016", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "0-9999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "100000", "legal_status": "Charity", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Frank Cranmer", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "Secretary"}
