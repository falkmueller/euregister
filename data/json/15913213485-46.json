This is still essential as governments\u2019 pesticide evaluation lags many years behind product development and Europe\u2019s pesticide approval process has yet to tackle new concerns like endocrine disruption and increased sensitivity among children and foetuses. We have also seen that the latest generation of pesticides sold by chemicals companies are not appreciably safer for the environment or our health.
