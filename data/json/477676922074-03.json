Fredmund Malik has developed an all new thinking and management system designed to revolutionize the perspectives and opportunities of top leadership. They were created to empower top executives to reliably master growing complexity and the dynamic new challenges of the 21st century. Maliks systems constitute a new social technology for transformation and change. His innovative systems and methods apply where conventional management stops. A key element of Malik\u2019s approach is his broad understanding of management beyond profit making only as the very societal function that enables society and its diverse organizations to function properly especially under conditions of proliferating complexity. \nIn 1997 he first described and predicted by the name of \u201cThe Great Transformation21\u201d what we experience today: a long and protracted phase of mostly unexpected societal turbulence including financial instability and debt crises. Contrary to mainstream opinion, early on Malik has localized the roots of these turbulences beyond the world of finance in the increas-ing complexity of today\u2019s global systems and the growing inadequacy of conventional management methods to effectively deal with it. \nMalik was a Professor for General Corporate Management, Governance and Leadership at the University of St. Gallen, Switzerland and a Guest Professor at the Vienna University of Business and Economics (1992 \u2013 1998). He is Special Professor at three renowned Chinese Universities. 1984 he founded the Malik Institute in St. Gallen which he heads as chairman. The institute has been among the leading knowledge organizations for systems thinking, applied cybernetics and management solutions.
