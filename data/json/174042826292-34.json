We also ensure that civil society can be an active voice in ensuring the return and monitoring the use of confiscated stolen assets. We campaign against individuals and the structures that enable asset theft, we support cross-border civil society cooperation on asset recovery and we develop the expertise of civil society to be strong voices across the globe on asset theft.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+49)30 550 65 402"}
