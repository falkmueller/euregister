PHA biopolymer is a key feedstock for bioplastics. Objectives are specified as follows: 1) Finding a new production process for addition of PHB (/ V) suitable for standard plastics processing for film extrusion, 2) Determination of material properties and processing conditions for the preparation of the product specification for the customers. 3) Testing of the production process. 4) Testing of samples in situ in real terms. 5) Creating of documents for the dissemination of the production process  \n \nBiotechnology for the production of PHA biopolymer from waste cooking oil - The overall aim of the project is to introduce the innovative biotechnology \"HYDAL\" and the applied application know-how to the world market. The intention of the project is to contribute to address these global issues: 1) Pollution of the planet by synthetic plastic materials, 2) Wastes and their reuse, 3) Supporting \"Innovating to Zero\" Mega Trend - zero carbon emissions, zero waste and zero emissions, 4) Food security,  \n5) Environmental protection, 6) Circular economy. \n \nTransfer of biotechnology Hydal to China - The main aim of the present project is: 1) Transfer of biotechnology Hydal to China; 2) Building of a Pilot Plant in the premises of Nanopolis (SIP) in Suzhou; 3) Initiation and verification of Pilot Plant of biotechnology Hydal; 4) Optimization of biotechnology to the conditions of China; 5) Transfer of \"the best practices\" gained by international cooperation in the Czech Republic \n \nOptimization of the Hydal technology at industrial scale - Project objectives: 1) Increase productivity and efficiency of research activities of NFG in cooperation with Microbiology Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences; 2) Strengthen economy development sustainability by optimising the Hydal technology. Biotechnology utilises 100% waste (used cooking oil), which has no other use. The oil is used as energy source at the same time to lower product carbon footprint; 3) Increase competitiveness of the Czech economy supply and use of this Czech biotechnology will be on a global scale. \n \nResearch in the area nanofiber applications and applications NanoBio \u2013 The aim of the project is realisation of industrial scale research and development in following fields: 1) nanofibrous applications for water and air filtration; 2) nanofibrous applications for cosmetics; 3) Nanobio high end applications. \n \nMaterial base development for 3D printing based on Hydal PHA - The aim of this project is development of material base for application of bio-technologically produced HYDAL PHA in the field of 3D printing. Development will focus on development of compaunds based on HYDAL PHA for manufacture of filaments for FDM (Fuse Deposition Modelling) 3D printing with following particular targets: 1) Development of base material formulation exhibiting desired flow and thermo-mechanical properties suitable for filaments extrusion and subsequent processing by FDM 3D printing, combining base polymers with majority of HYDAL PHA. 2) Additivation and reactive compaundation of base recipes for adjustment of properties for processing and final product properties of the 3D printing, mainly thermo-stable and mechanical properties. 3) Pilot manufacturing of filament prototype and its testing.", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2016", "lat": "50.1183251", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "0-9999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "0", "legal_status": "akciov\u00e1 spole\u010dnost", "procurement": "", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "goals__remit": "NAFIGATE Corporation, a.s. je knowledge based company, kter\u00e1 se specializuje na v\u00fdzkum a v\u00fdvoj ve 2 oblastech: 1) nanovl\u00e1kenn\u00e9 aplikace, 2) materi\u00e1lov\u00e9 vyu\u017eit\u00ed odpad\u016f - up-cycling odpadn\u00edch olej\u016f na biopolymer PHA. \nNa glob\u00e1ln\u00ed trh spole\u010dnost uvedla 2 pr\u016flomov\u00e9 inovace, a to  nanovl\u00e1kenn\u00e9 aplikace zalo\u017een\u00e9 na \u010desk\u00e9 technologii Nanospider a biotechnologii Hydal.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+420)734201248"}
