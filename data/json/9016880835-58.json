The main BSSSC event is the annual conference held each year in early autumn (end of September - beginning of October). \n \nBSSSC co-operates closely with other key Baltic Sea Region and European organisations and institutions. \nThe BSSSC has signed a Declaration of Common Interest with the Committee of the Regions in 2007 and opened its network for other BSR organisations on local and regional level to become participants (CBSS, CPMR Baltic Sea Commission, B7, UBC, NSPA).", "belgium_office_city": "Bruxelles", "head_office_phone": "(+47)9 5962123"}
