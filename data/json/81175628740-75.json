Norway has always been a maritime nation; shipping is an important part of our identity - and is a key aspect of Norwegian industry, settlement and employment. The maritime industries account for more than seven percent of value creation in Norway and now represent a vital, rounded and competitive industrial cluster. \n \nThe shipowners and offshore companies are the core of this industrial cluster. As an employers\u2019 and professional organisation for its member companies, the NSA\u2019s objective is to realise the added value inherent in a communality of focus, to the benefit of the industry and the individual member. It is our aim to translate our members\u2019 value-creation, ability to innovate, power and influence \u2013 and Norway\u2019s overall maritime status and reputation \u2013 into effective action in the industry\u2019s interests, both nationally and internationally.", "industry_forums": "", "head_office_phone": "(+47)22401500", "level_of_interest": "European, global, national, regional/local", "relevant_communication": "", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2017", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "300000-399999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "0", "legal_status": "Industry Association", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Amund Dr\u00f8nen Ringdal", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "Director"}
