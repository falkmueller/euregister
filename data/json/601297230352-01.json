Whether they are for-profit or not-for-profit, they have a key role to play in the creation of social and corporate value that can \u2013 and should \u2013 go hand in hand. The leaders in this transition are those who understand the importance of \u201cbeing connected\u201d: with their own aspirations, with the people around them, and with the organizations and communities to which they contribute. As a consultant and coach, I delight in supporting people to become these sought-after leaders. \nI have been a communication and management consultant for more than 17 years, working with businesses, industrial associations, universities, and government agencies. I combine management-oriented degrees (MSc in Bioengineering and Industrial Marketing) with more people-oriented training (Body-focused Therapist).", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+32)496103521"}
