It acts in complete independence from national or private interests, public authorities or any pressure group. \nEstablished in 1946, ELEC was in 1948 one of the founding members of the European Movement. Its mission includes the mobilisation of its members in support of projects that embody the European common interests through the circulation of information, the organisation of debates and the publication of papers on important European themes. \nELEC is built as a federation of national sections present in a number of European countries. The membership of its national sections is drawn largely from economic and financial circles; but it also maintains close contacts with senior national and European civil servants as well as academics and policy makers, whose expertise and influence stimulate the exchanges and broaden their scope and quality.", "industry_forums": "", "head_office_phone": "(+32)0496280305", "level_of_interest": "European", "relevant_communication": "", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2017", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "0-9999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "53005", "legal_status": "Non-profit international association", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Fran\u00e7ois Baudu", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "secretary general"}
