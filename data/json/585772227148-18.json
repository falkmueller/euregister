The milestones set in the SRA are used to define the contents of the HPC Technology R&D Work Programmes managed by the European Commission. \n \nThe SRA reflects the needs of the European HPC Technology providers and other members of the European HPC eco-system, i.e.: PRACE (academic users), industrial HPC end-users, Independent Software Vendors. Conclusions and roadmaps made available by other initiatives such as HiPeac and the Big Data community (represented by the Big Data Value Association) are also taken into account.  \n \nThe roadmap, is updated approximately every 18 month. It is  developed through a series of internal and external workshops. A team of ETP4HPC experts supervised and managed the process, while the technical areas were developed by Working Groups led by members of ETP4HPC. All members of ETP4HPC are able to participate in the development of the SRA. \nThe SRA is the work of experts associated with ETP4HPC.", "level_of_interest": "European", "organisation_name": "European Technology Platform for High Performance Computing (ETP4HPC)", "belgium_office_post_code": "", "procurement": "", "section": "IV - Think tanks, research and academic institutions", "lon": 4.8422952, "source": "", "belgium_office_address": "", "belgium_office_phone": "", "number_of_ep_accredited_persons": "", "overall_budget_turnover_as_a_range": "", "subsection": "Think tanks and research institutions", "no_geo_reference": true, "persons_accredited_for_access_to_european_parliament_premises": "", "estimate_of_costs_absolute_amount": "", "registration_date": "18/05/2017", "website_address": "http://www.etp4hpc.eu/", "commission_expert_groups_and_other_similar_entities_european_commission": "NA", "head_office_post_box": "", "head_office_city": "Amsterdam", "membership": "", "head_office_post_code": "1042 AC", "goals__remit": "ETP4HPC is an industry-led think tank and advisory group of companies and research centres involved in High-Performance Computing (i.e. Supercomputing) technology research in Europe.
