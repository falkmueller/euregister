Having successfully upgraded the UK\u2019s biggest power station through innovative engineering, we are now a predominantly biomass-fuelled generator. 70% of the electricity we produce \u2013 enough to power Leeds, Manchester, Sheffield and Liverpool \u2013 is now made using compressed wood pellets rather than coal. \n \nOur US business employs innovative manufacturing techniques, using wood from responsibly managed working forests to produce compressed biomass pellets. These pellets are shipped safely and efficiently around the world to generate reliable, renewable energy precisely when it\u2019s needed. We plan to self-supply an increasing percentage of the wood pellets we use at Drax Power Station. \n \nAt the other end of our supply chain, Drax Group\u2019s retail division serves the energy needs of a growing number of SMEs and large organisations. Our ability to inspire customers to change the type of energy they use and then work with them to use it more efficiently and affordably, establishes our current and future retail brands as the biggest challengers in the market. \n \nToday we are one of the UK\u2019s largest energy producers and we stand ready to do more, helping to reduce carbon emissions, forcing more coal off the system and providing additional system support to plug the gaps created by intermittent renewables and boost security of supply.", "industry_forums": "", "head_office_phone": "(+44)1757 618381", "level_of_interest": "global, national", "relevant_communication": "", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2017", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "50000-99999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "0", "legal_status": "plc", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Matthew Willey", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "Group Head of External Affairs"}
