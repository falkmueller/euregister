We are established by our member churches and funded by them. Our present day membership reflects the changing landscape of Christianity across Protestant, Orthodox, Reformed, Catholic, Independent and Migrant\u2013led churches. Our newest Member, the Redeemed Christian Church of God is the largest migrant\u2013led Church in Ireland with over 15,000 members throughout Ireland and the latest Census lists over 45,000 Orthodox adherents. When added to the membership of our longer established traditions we encompass the vast majority of Christians within Ireland. \nThrough our structures churches in Ireland from across the wide range of established traditions have been meeting together on an ongoing and all\u2013island basis for over 90 years. Countless positive changes have taken place as a consequence of the relationships formed, bridges built and actions taken through and beyond our dialogues together.", "industry_forums": "", "inter_groups": "", "number_of_persons_involved": "15", "relevant_communication": "Peace funding for Northern Ireland", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2016", "lat": 54.58496969999999, "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "10000-24999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "232303", "legal_status": "charity", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Nicola Brady", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "General Secretary", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+44)2890663145"}
