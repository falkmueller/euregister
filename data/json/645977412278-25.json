It pursues this objective by working for the development, expansion and improvement of international and regional treaties and agreements and also of national laws relating to IP. It operates by conducting studies of existing national laws and proposes measures to achieve harmonization of these laws on an international basis. In this context AIPPI has become increasingly concerned with issues concerning the enforcement of intellectual property rights.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+41)044 280 58 80"}
