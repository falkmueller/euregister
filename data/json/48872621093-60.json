The coalition has been set up in 2006 and has established a coordination office in Brussels. \n \nWe are guided by a vision of a sustainable world in which corporations\u2019 drive for profit is balanced with the interests of society at large, and where businesses respect human, social and environmental rights. \n \nECCJ works as a catalyst, drawing on the expertise and experience of organisations across Europe to build a strong corporate accountability movement and provide a united voice at the European level promoting the need for legal change. We build capacities of our members to engage in the EU policy debate and connect it with discussions at national level. \n \nWe carry out research with lawyers, academics and civil society organisations in other regions of the world to make the case for greater corporate accountability \n \nWe identify and promote legal proposals and policy recommendations for the EU and its Member States to address the gaps in governance created by economic globalisation. We raise public awareness on how the EU should ensure better protection for human rights and the environment.  \n \nIn particular, we have the following policy objectives \n- Increase corporate transparency: mandatory disclosure of companies' risks and impacts on human rights and environment and how companies address them  \n- Embed the corporate duty to respect human rights into law: legal measures to make sure that companies respect human rights throughout their operations and in relation to their business relationships including outside the EU \n- Address the obstacles faced by victims of corporate-related human rights abuses when trying to access judicial remedies \n \nGOVERNANCE STRUCTURE \n \nECCJ\u2019s 21 member organisations constitute the coalition\u2019s General Assembly. General Assembly meetings take place once a year to approve the annual work plan and budget, and make decisions regarding core strategic and political issues.   \n \nECCJ is is led by an elected board, called Steering Group, made up of representatives of member organisations. The Steering Group is responsible for ECCJ\u2019s Strategic Plan and oversees its implementation through annual Operational Plans. It approves main ECCJ positions with respect to key policy developments and oversees the coalition\u2019s financial management, ensuring its long term financial stability. The Steering Group guides the work of the Secretariat and supports its Coordinator. Members of the Steering Group may occasionally represent ECCJ in public events.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+32)28931026"}
