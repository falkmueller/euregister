In their countries, ACA members are involved in a wide range of activities in the field of internationalisation of education, with particular focus on management of exchange programmes, promotion of national education and culture abroad, research and data collection, provision of education-related information and consultation, and formulating policy advice. In addition to its full members, ACA also has a number of associate members. These are national organisations of a similar profile, placed outside of Europe.  \nACA has been involved in a wide range of EU initiatives through providing expertise in the course of EU policy-making processes, as coordinator and partner in European projects in the field of higher education, culture and research (Socrates, Tempus, Erasmus Mundus, Lifelong Learning Programme, Erasmus+, Horizon 2020). ACA has actively participated in policy formulation as a research and advisory body on student and staff mobility in Europe, internationalisation of higher education, English-medium programmes in European higher education, Open Education, etc. \nACA\u2019s expertise ranges from mobility to many more themes linked to the European higher education discourse and agendas (curricular internationalisation, system-level innovation, access to higher education and services for international students, quality assurance, the role of ICT in fostering knowledge, and the positioning of European higher education globally). \nACA is currently involved in several projects, among others as partner in the Study in Europe project \u2013 global promotion of Europe as a study destination, IMPALA \u2013 a capacity-building project with South African universities, MasterMind Europe project which addresses admissions to master\u2019s programme in Europe, etc.  \nIn 2016, ACA conducted a study for the European Parliament on the mid-term review of Erasmus+ decentralised actions, which was presented at the EP on several occasions.

Since its landmark study EURODATA (2006), ACA has produced a number of relevant studies on mobility (such as MOWIN, STiME, MPPC). ACA has also produced 3 major studies on English-medium instruction in Europe.  \nSome of the most recent publications include the study for the European Parliament on the first years of Erasmus+ implementation, a report on admissions to master-level programmes in Europe, the third study on English-medium programmes in Europe (English-Taught Programmes in European Higher Education.
