If access is available, we are often required to pay again. \n \nThe mission of the United Academics Foundation (UAF) is to connect science and society: creating a world where scientific research results are accessible for all, so that knowledge can easily spread and be built upon. \nSupporting Open Access \n \nIn the current scientific publishing system, the gatekeepers limit access to research by charging high membership fees to individuals, companies, research centers and libraries. Furthermore, authors lose copyrights, re-use of articles is restricted and the publication process is inexorably slow. Fortunately, times are changing. Open Access publishing is supported and even demanded by more and more academics. Several legislators worldwide have already committed to implementing an Open Access-only policy. The question is no longer \u2018if\u2019 we should have Open Access. The question is about \u2018how\u2019 we should develop it and promote it further.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+31)206204446"}
