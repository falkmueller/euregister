The paper aims at contributing to the information and discussion on potential development of legislative or other measures to protect children and young people from negative types of online business practices and abuses: for instance, advertising and selling products and services online, that use children improperly or target them in a harmful way that could harm their mental, physical or moral development. \nAs part of its strategy to strengthen the dialogue with children and let them participate directly into the network\u2019s activities, eNACSO developed a child friendly report based on the Policy Paper on \u2018When Free Isn\u2019tBusiness, Children and the Internet\u2019.
