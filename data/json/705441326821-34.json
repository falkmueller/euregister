However, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) continues to spread, as over-use and misuse is rendering many antibiotics ineffective. By 2050, 10 million people each year are predicted to die as a result of drug resistant infections. Currently, there few new antibiotics in development. Therefore, we must focus on reducing the incidence of bacterial infectious disease, ensuring rational use of the remaining antibiotics and reducing transmission of resistant bacteria. We must also undertake further research to better understand how resistance develops and spreads in the environment. We also need to develop diagnostic tools and better surveillance methods as well as validating smarter strategies for using antibiotics in healthcare and agriculture. \n \nThe Joint Programming Initiative on Antimicrobial Resistance, JPIAMR, coordinates national funding and supports collaborative action for filling knowledge gaps on AMR. By mobilising existing and new resources, this initiative develops a critical mass and attracts new researchers to the AMR field. Our Strategic Research Agenda outlines the key areas to address and provides guidance documents for countries to align their AMR research agendas nationally and internationally. \n \nAs resistant bacteria do not observe national borders, JPIAMR works on an international level. By engaging nations beyond Europe as members, the JPIAMR platform enables collaborative actions in areas of unmet needs. \n \nJPIAMR\u00b4s main ambition is to reduce AMR by supporting scientific activities at international level. This will offer evidence-based solutions at policy, public health and veterinarian/agricultural levels. \n \nwww.jpiamr.eu", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+46)854644000"}
