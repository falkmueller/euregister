MEMBERS AND COVERAGE - CEEMET Members are national employer organisations, almost universally with a legal social partner mandate from metal, engineering and technology-based industries in 22 countries. CEEMET members are responsible for representing the social policy and industrial relations' interests of the metal companies in the country concerned, and, where so existing, for the conclusion of \nthe collective agreements in the metal industry. CEEMET has the Australian Industry Group (Ai Group) as an associated Member. CEEMET also has contacts with cross-industry employers\u2019 organisations in countries where no \nemployer organisation of the metal, engineering and technology-based industries exist and here in particular in the new EU Member \nStates, such as SP of the Czech Republic, MGYOSZ of Hungary, PKPP and KPP of Poland. The member organisations of CEEMET \ncover -in principle- the entire range of sectors of the manufacturing industries, including  \n\u2022 Basic Metals  \n\u2022 Fabricated Metal Goods  \n\u2022Mechanical Engineering  \n\u2022 Electrical and Electronical Industry \n\u2022 ICT Industries \n\u2022 Medical, precision and optical instruments, watches \netc.  \n\u2022 Transportation Means (automobile, ship, aircraft)  \n\u2022 Instrument Engineering.  \n \nSome national member organisations also cover the \nmetal producing industries (iron and steel) or parts of it foundries. Altogether, the CEEMET Members represent about 200,000 member companies employing  35 million workers. The objectives as laid down in the statutes of CEEMET are \u201cto promote the exchange of information among its members on all social issues which directly affect interests of these industries. It is also to facilitate \nconcerted views and the formulation of statements on matters of common interest. In achieving these purposes the Association may \nmake such representation to international organisations as is required.\" CEEMET activities and tasks are based on two pillars: - the \nexchange and structural documentation of national information on industrial relations, labour law or training matters in the metal and \nelectrical industry - the follow-up of European matters, including lobbying on dossiers of particular interest to our industry. CEEMET \nfollows the wide spectrum of social policy affairs via different Groups and Committees which meet regularly and deal with matters on - \"Industrial and Employee Relations\", - \"European Union\" - covering labour law and social protection - \"Education, Training and Employability\" - \"Health and Safety\" and - \"Socio-Economic Trends\". In January 2010 CEEMET and the EMF (European Metalworkers Federation) have set up a sectoral social dialogue committee covering the metal, engineering and technology-based industries - this committee was set up with the approval and recognition of the European Commission. Occasionally, CEEMET activities also address manufacturing specific issues at global level, in particular at ILO and and IOE level. CEEMET nearly entirely \nfinanced through membership contributions from its national member organisations.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+32)027068465"}
