Practicing veterinarians may be self-employed, an associate partner, or work as salaried assistant or locum (relief veterinarian). In some countries, veterinary practitioners are employed by the state or by municipalities. \n \nThough all veterinarians receive a general basic training, encompassing all animal species and diseases, a growing number of practitioners are specializing in one or more species (such as companion animals, horses, pigs or exotic animals) or in a particular discipline (e.g. dermatology, surgery, internal medicine, reproduction, ophthalmology). \n \nThe interests of practicing veterinarians on a European level are represented since 1970 by the UEVP, the European umbrella organization of national veterinary practitioners' associations", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+32)25337020"}
