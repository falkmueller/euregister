Democracy International aims to strengthen direct democracy and citizens\u2019 participation on the local, national and transnational level across the globe. Democracy International stands for a globalisation of democracy and a democratisation of transnational decision-making processes. \n \n \nDemocracy International intends to realise these main goals to accomplish its mission: \n \nLearning and exchange \nDemocracy, the democratic procedural law and how it is practiced, is never completed but always in process. Different countries with different cultures develop a different kind of democracy. Yet, even if there is nothing like \"the ideal democracy\" we can constantly learn from each other and exchange experience with different styles and forms of democracy. \n \nHelp and develop \nWe aim to build cross-border support and transnational solidarity among citizens and democracy groups. Democracy International seeks to offer support by sharing expertise and lessons learnt through three decades of experience; by advising on organisational development and campaigning; and by connecting activist and experts around the globe. \n \nTransnational drawing together \nToday democracy is mainly a governmental form of states and sub-national political entities. International politics is still largely in the hands of national governments. With the European Union, forms of direct democracy have begun to emerge also at supranational level. Democracy International seeks to consolidate this process and foster the development of transnational democratic structures.", "industry_forums": "", "head_office_phone": "(+49)22031802881", "level_of_interest": "European, global", "relevant_communication": "", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2017", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "317000", "legal_status": "eingetragener Verein", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Daniela Vancic", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "European Program Manager"}
