Our mission is to work with horses, horse owners, communities, organisations and governments to help improve welfare standards and stamp out suffering in the UK and worldwide. \n \nWe work across the UK with horses, horse owners, the veterinary profession, sport bodies, law enforcement and government to promote and protect the welfare of horses. \n \nOur network of Field Officers investigate and resolve thousands of reports of horses in distress made to our Welfare Line each year. Sometimes this can be as simple as advising owners, and where necessary we will take horses into our care. \n \nWe are the UK's largest horse rescue and rehoming charity, and at our four Rescue and Rehoming Centres horses in need can receive urgent and specialist care. Once their rehabilitation is complete, we hope that every horse in our care can find a loving new home through our rehoming scheme - as valuable companions, competition horses, and everything in-between. \n \nInternationally, World Horse Welfare is committed to improving thousands of working equids\u2019 lives and their owners\u2019 livelihoods. Our practical international training programmes improve horse care and livelihoods in some of the world's poorest communities. Our training teams work with horse-owning communities to identify the barriers to better horse care, teach them new skills and help them better feed and tend to their most important asset. \n \nOur founding campaign was to end the long-distance transportation of horses across Europe to slaughter, and this remains a key goal of the organisation today. We also campaign on a range of diverse issues, including equine legislation in the UK, equine identification, welfare at slaughter and welfare in sport.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+44)01953498682"}
