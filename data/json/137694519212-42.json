The purpose of the markings is to institute a standard of explosives product marking that will allow for supply-chain accountability and tracing of explosives in commerce if products are lost or misappropriated.  Specifically, IME proposed the addition of a new note to chapter 1.4 (Security) of the Model Regulations to provide a format for countries to consider whenever explosives security markings are required.  The proposed markings are based upon EC Directive 2008/43/EC. IME is communicating with officials of the EC to address  the Commission\u2019s concerns and encourage the Commission to support our proposal. \n \nThis proposal was accepted by the UN TDG Sub-committee and approved by the TDG/GHS Committee in December 2017 and will appear as a note in Chapter 1.4 of the UN Model Regulations.", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2017", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "25000-49999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "0", "legal_status": "Association", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "David Boston", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "UN Consultant"}
