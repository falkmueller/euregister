Geneva Call gives ANSAs the opportunity to adhere to and respect the norms of International Humanitarian Law (IHL) and Inter- national Human Rights Law (IHRL). Common Article 3 to the Geneva Conventions provides a solid basis for humanitarian engagement with ANSAs, by establishing the right for impartial humanitarian organizations to offer their services to the parties to a conflict. To achieve this, Geneva Call seeks a formal undertaking by ANSAs, inviting them to sign and comply with different Deeds of Commitment to respect these norms. Signatory ANSAs agree that Geneva Call will monitor and verify their compliance. Geneva Call is currently focusing its efforts on banning the use of Anti-Personnel mines, protecting children from the effects of armed conflict, prohibiting sexual violence in armed conflict and working towards the elimination of gender discrimination. Geneva Call also responds to ANSA requests to help build their knowledge of, and capacities to implement, IHL and IHRL. Geneva Call conducts its activities according to humanitarian principles of neutrality, impartiality, and independence. Transparency is also a core working principle: as a matter of policy, Geneva Call informs stakeholders, including the States concerned, of its engagement efforts with ANSAs.", "industry_forums": "", "head_office_phone": "(+41)228791050", "level_of_interest": "global", "relevant_communication": "In 2013 Geneva Call started its activities at the European Parliament. During November and December, representatives met Members of Parliament and their advisors in order to raise awareness of the activities of Geneva Call and prepare the ground for parliamentary questions and a Recommendation on civilian protection in armed conflict. \n \nFollowing a meeting with one Member of Parliament, Geneva Call sent proposals to her office for suggestions of amendments to the Human Rights Report 2012 of the Committee for Foreign Affairs of the European Parliament. Two specific amendments were proposed based on Geneva Call's suggestions, one of which was included in the final report following a vote by the Committee. \n \nOn 12 March 2014, following discussions initiated by Geneva Call, the European Parliament unanimously passed a recommendation to the European Council to support the engagement of armed non-State actors on child protection in armed conflict. The recommendation urges the European Commission to encourage the signing of action plans for the protection of children in armed conflict by concerned States and armed non-State actors, and adherence by armed non-State actors to Geneva Call\u2019s Deed of Commitment protecting children in armed conflict.", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2016", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "0-9999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "4903163", "legal_status": "Foundation under Swiss Law", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Maud Bonnet", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "Head of Communications and External Relations"}
