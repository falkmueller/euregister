Founded in 1992, ENCATC represents all disciplines in the cultural sector, is an NGO holding the status of official partner of UNESCO and of observer to the Steering Committee for Culture of the Council of Europe. Through a wide range of projects, activities and events, ENCATC offers academics, researchers, cultural operators, students, artists, and policy makers a platform to transfer knowledge and share ideas, projects, methodologies, experiences and research. In line with its mission and aims, ENCATC activities are structured around four complementary strands of work: influencing policy, networking, education, and research. ENCATC efficiently contributes to the professionalization and sustainability of the cultural sector. It also stimulates innovative thinking by researching trends and developments that affect the future of culture, by supporting businesses and organizations with strategy development by means of scenario planning, and by developing new curricula, services and business concepts based on these scenarios. Through a number of mobility programmes ENCATC actively encourages the mobility of educators, students, artists, cultural operators across sectors and among countries because this experience is invaluable for capacity development, for the internationalisation of careers and for the achievement of the Europe 2020 objectives. ENCATC fosters initiatives bringing together diverse actors, disciplines and domains. By doing this, ENCATC has established strong partnerships with major international and European institutions, cultural organisations and networks.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+32)22012912"}
