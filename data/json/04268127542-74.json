Its products are the result of innovative ideas, and are therefore often inimitable, despite being widely distributed, and have become part of the collective memory and customs of many countries, where they are often considered true cultural icons. \n \nFerrero also means caring about hygiene, the environment, social issues and the local communities where the company is present, as well as its own human resources. \nToday many Ferrero products are \u201cglobal\u201d, in that they are sold everywhere. Ferrero is now the fourth largest confectionery group in the world. \n \nHowever Ferrero\u2019s distinguishing characteristic is that it is \u201cglocal\u201d (think globally, act locally), a company which is both global and local, which focuses on international development, without losing sight of its relationship with local communities. \n \nThe consumer is always at the centre of our strategy. Ferrero\u2019s relationship with its consumers is based on longstanding and mutual trust, built up over the years with expertise, experience, understanding and intuition. This is a measure of Ferrero\u2019s interest in consumer needs, and this is a key factor of the company\u2019s success.", "industry_forums": "", "inter_groups": "", "number_of_persons_involved": "5", "relevant_communication": "Ferrero Corporate Social Responsibility Reports available here: http://www.ferrerocsr.com/", "financial_year_end_date": "01/08/2017", "lat": 49.62404429999999, "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "200000-299999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "0", "legal_status": "S.A.", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Alessandro Cagli", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "EU Public Affairs Director", "belgium_office_city": "Brussels", "head_office_phone": "(+352)3497111"}
