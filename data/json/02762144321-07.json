Through regular monitoring, we seek to identify threats and opportunities of policy changes.  Our services are tailored to the specific needs of each client.  An international perspective is a distinctive feature of our work.   \n \nWe believe that advice on any policy area would not be complete without consideration of the social dimension and the international context.  We assist our clients in putting these various aspects into perspective, assessing the relative importance of the EU\u2019s activities, and in formulating an appropriate and effective response.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+32)22503210"}
