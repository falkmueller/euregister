The aim of the Forum is to improve the health of the population by promoting strong Primary Care. This is done by advocating for Primary Care, by generating data and evidence on Primary Care and by exchanging information between its members. \nStrong primary care (PC) produces better health outcomes against lower costs. That is the briefest summary of available scientific evidence. By promoting strong PC the population's health can be improved. Strong PC does not emerge spontaneously. It requires appropriate conditions at the health care system level and in actual practice to make PC providers able and willing to take responsibility for the health of the population under their care. Everywhere in Europe the process of strengthening PC is ongoing. There is a strong need to collect and share information about what structures and strategies matter.", "industry_forums": "", "head_office_phone": "(+31)302729611", "level_of_interest": "European", "relevant_communication": "Position Papers about Primary Care linked sub-themes \nYearly conference in September about the future of Primary Care in Europe \nTwo weekly newsflash with updates on International Primary Care developments, events and publications \nSearch Engine about Primary Care publications in Europe \nWebinars about topics related to Primary Care", "financial_year_end_date": "01/06/2018", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "144117", "legal_status": "Association", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Diederik Aarendonk", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "Coordinator"}
