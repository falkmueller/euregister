Better and swifter enforcement is needed to cope with the threat of nationalist protectionism and consequent distortion of competition. \n\u2022 Stronger commitment: The Single Market should not just be an abstract concept, but should be fully supported by EU institutions and Member States, without political fudging. \n \nDigital single market:  \n\u2022 Rules on consumer guarantees, online and digital purchases which facilitates cross-border trade \n\u2022 Accesibility requirements for traders \n\u2022 E-privacy and data protection; consent for cookies as well as profiling and transperency issues  \n \nCircular economy: \n\u2022 Promotion of good retail practices and voluntary initiatives through REAP  \n\u2022 (Food) waste prevention measures \n\u2022 Improving the environmental impact of packaging (waste) \n\u2022 F-Gas exit program \n \nConsumer rights: \n\u2022 Consumer satisfaction and confidence: The absolute priority of retail and wholesale is to respond to consumer expectations and evolve constantly with their needs. Consumers must be able to shop in the knowledge that they are well protected from dangerous products, disreputable traders and dishonest practices.  \n\u2022 Consumer redress: Any proposal on consumer redress must be practical, cost-effective, efficient, and recognise that most problems are settled directly between customers and businesses.  \n\u2022 Legislation and labelling: Consumer legislation proposals must add value to consumers and provide opportunity for businesses, as unnecessarily burdensome regulations result in high compliance costs and higher prices for consumers.
