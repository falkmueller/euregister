It is vital that the EU pursues a policy that strengthens the accessibility of Europe\u2019s secondary and tertiary destinations both through direct connections and through European hubs to maintain and develop connectivity and consumer choice on a long term, always in a fair and competitive environment, both within the EU and with regards to non-EU competitors. \nAviation is fiercely competitive. Airlines can compete provided there is a level playing field, therefore E4FC continues its effort to enforce international and EU-level aviation and trade rules, ensure fair and equitable competition and a satisfactory level playing field.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+32)025123722"}
