The objective is to achieve a single scheme for assessment and certification of products and materials that are used in drinking water applications, which will be accepted in all EU Member States. \n \nMember of the Europan Water Alliance and WssTP \n \nAE two years ago established an industry grouping concerned with materials in contact with drinking water (CPR) which has now been transformed into European Drinking Water, an industry network of some 30+ Brussels-based trade bodies.
