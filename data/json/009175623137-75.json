We represent education employers in all levels of education, from pre-school to higher education institutions. This includes different national organisations, such as education councils and ministries of education, associations of colleges and universities and local and regional authority employers\u2019 organisations. In total we have 32 members representing 16 European countries. Our mission is to improve the quality of teaching and school management through European cooperation and dialogue. EFEE acts on behalf of its members in its role as officially recognised European social partner in education and as an official dialogue partner to EU institutions. Our aims are to raise awareness on and increase commitment to the European policy agenda, influence European policy, dialogue with unions, network and be the voice of our members at EU level. EFEE strives to represent the whole of the diverse education sector and is recognised by the European Commission as an official European social partner in the policy consultation process.

This Programme consists of 7 pillars, identified since 2013.  \n \nPillar I Participation in DG EAC TWGs: \nSince 2013, members of EFEE and secretariat take part in ET2020 Thematic Working Groups of DG EAC. The secretariat coordinates input to the Working Groups and the output of WGs are communicated to all EFEE members. EFEE takes part in the WGs on: Schools, Modernization of Higher Education, Vocational Education and Training, Adult Learning, Digital Skills and Competences and on Promoting citizenship and the common values of freedom, tolerance and non-discrimination through education. \n \nPillar II Social Dialogue working groups \nAs European social partners in Education, we deem it important to consider in our work the impact of economical, social and demographic developments on the education sector and to continue to focus our joint work on topics that have sufficient common ground for discussion and for initiatives with a clear added value for cooperation at European level. Herewith we take also in consideration the agenda of the European Commission in the field of education, employment and social affairs, in particular the work of DG Education and Culture and DG Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion. We wish to contribute to the improvement of the quality of education in Europe thereby focusing on the modernisation of the education sector, its managements and its teaching personnel. In all our work we keep in mind the gender equality principle. \n \nPillar III EC Consultations & policy papers  \nAs recognised European Social Partner in Education, EFEE is officially consulted by the European Commission when a new legislative initiative is taken in the area of employment and social affairs, according to the EU Treaty. Moreover, we see a tendency of increasingly stakeholders\u2019 consultation of the EC when it comes to educational matters.  \nHerewith some examples of recent EFEE statements: \n- EFEE&CEEP Joint Response on A New Skills Agenda for Europe (2016) \n- EFEE Position Paper on The economic case for education and training in the Europe2020 context (2015) \n- EFEE & ETUCE Pledge for European Alliance for Apprenticeship (2015) \n \nPilar IV Enhanced partnerships activities \n\u2022 EFEE is member of European Policy Network on School Leadership. \n\u2022 We ensure representation of the education sector at cross-sectoral social partner meetings with CEEP. \n\u2022 Take part in Public Services Employers meetings to link with other sectors. \n\u2022 Promote link VET with labour market through work as member of European Alliance for apprenticeships. \n \nPillar V Capacity Building activities: \n\u2022 Recruiting new members to reinforce network is one of our key priorities. \n\u2022 Furthermore we train existing and potential members on EU Policies in the field of education, training and research and on European Sectoral Social Dialogue.  \n \nPillar VI Peer Learning activities \nEFEE organises Peer Learning activities for its members. In May 2016 we organised a meeting in Malta on promoting civic education, intercultural dialogue and democratic citizenship and other competencies to facilitate the migrants' integration. \n \nPillar VII  Dissemination and communication activities \n\u2022    Regarding the briefing of our members on European policy developments following the agenda of DG EAC and DG EMPL, Council Conclusions, upcoming activities, and stakeholder consultations, we sent out newsflashes to our members. \n\u2022    We make use of social media to reach a broader audience. At our LinkedIn company page regular updates are published on events and publications. All relevant news and important information is published on EFEE's website.
