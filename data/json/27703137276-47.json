As known, this occurred twice in the past. It produced big negative effects: first, with the defeat of the united European armies at Moh\u00e1cs in 1526 and second, when totalitarian systems got a grip on the East, holding it back, between 1945-1989.  \n \nThereafter, with the freedom movements of 1989 and with the EU enlargements of 1995, 2004, 2007 and 2008, we all enjoy new chances to induce impulses in legislation and institutions so that the two parts of the continent converge.  \n \nBased on the company motto \u201cEX ORIENTE LUX. EX OCCIDENTE LEX\u201d, we support both Western European (esp. German) as well as South-Eastern European (esp. Romanian) companies, academic institutions and NGOs by developing and managing political contacts in a sound and principle-based manner. We are here for supporting the development of sound pieces of legislation in the above mentioned sense. \n \nWe consult strategically and multidisciplinarily, hands-on and result-driven, so that you can develop long-term partnerships across borders.  \n \nIndividual areas of action comprise: \n \n1. Concepts of political cooperation between parties from Eastern and Western Europe on specific issues: economic & financial policy; foreign policy. \n \n2. Support MEPs and specialized committees for fully understanding the heavy impact of immigration from people with non-European cultural roots on the EU and the MS.
