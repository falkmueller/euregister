ENAAT involves groups and individuals who see the arms trade as a threat to peace, security and development. Activities vary from campaigning against the financing of arms exports by governments, banks and pension funds to lobbying for stricter export control rules. ENAAT is not a membership organisation and there is no central secretariat or overall policy. All participants have their own expertise and strategy.  \nENAAT is committed to transparency about EU lobbying.  \nENAAT believes that the Transparency Register fails basic transparency standards and does not yet live up to its name. We support ALTER-EU's demand for a mandatory nature of the register, safeguards against underreporting, and publication of the names of interest  \nrepresentatives. \nWhen registering, we have therefore chosen to provide additional information that we consider necessary and relevant for lobbying transparency. A credible EU lobbying transparency register should include names of individual lobbyists and the issues that they try to influence, provide precise and comparable financial information on lobbying, and have effective monitoring and sanctions to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information disclosed. \nOur registration is based on the guidelines for transparent registration developed by the Civil Society Contact Group and ALTER-EU.
