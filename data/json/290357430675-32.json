EUSEA supports new initiatives and provides trainings e.g. for members in Southeast Europe and in the Baltic countries, including Russia. Eusea member institutions cover almost all European countries and some non-European states such as Israel, Georgia or Egypt. \n \nEusea members can provide experience and knowledge to conduct complex public engagement and science communication strategies addressing a wide range of target groups. The geographic distribution of Eusea members allows the organisation to cover most European countries. \n \nOver the past few years, several Eusea members have developed innovative forms of public engagement activities and formats, such as science parliaments, science picnics, citizen science projects or Researcher\u2019s Nights. Some members have also participated e.g. in the VOICES project. Social inclusion and citizen\u2019s science have been highlighted subjects at Eusea Annual Conferences, for knowledge and experience sharing.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+49)15123006370"}
