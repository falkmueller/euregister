Our independence and size allows us to be flexible and to tailor our services and costs to meet clients\u2019 specific requirements, thus avoiding the \u2018one size fits all\u2019 approach often adopted by larger global consultancies and law firms. Currently, our team of around 20 permanent consultants works for more than 25 clients in many sectors ranging from ICT, Energy, Metals, Financial Services, Health, Development, Education and Employment. \n \nOur reputation is built on success. A major element of this is listening to the organisations that we work with, understanding their real needs. Based on these needs we develop tailored programmes. The objective is always to provide real added value for our clients that will impact on their business development efforts. \n \nOur client services fall broadly into two categories (although the two inevitably overlap) funding as well as policy, therefore capturing the complete life cycle of an opportunity. Schuman Associates is specialised in supporting clients, leveraging market opportunities created by EU Funding Programmes and understanding and influencing the policy and regulatory framework driving these opportunities. We support a broad range of clients ranging from governments and large global firms to SMEs and NGOs and we are working in all major sectors including IT and security, energy and environment, trade and development, financial services, telecommunications, education and health. \n \nSchuman Associates is committed to the highest professional standards, integrity is key to our service to clients and in our relations with the European Institutions.
