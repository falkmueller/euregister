Its main activity is to refine imported raw cane sugar.  \nRAR develops many contacts with the European Instituitions in order to ensure the EU legislation secures the balance between the to main sources of sugar in the EU: refineries and beet producers.  \nSugar is a very heavily regulated market in Europe. Cane sugar currently accounts for around 20% of the total sugar and isoglucose availability in Europe.  \nAround 70% of Europe\u2019s cane sugar imports are typically sourced from developing countries with which the EU has a preferential trading relationship. These relationships are formalised under both the Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) and the Everything But Arms Agreements (EBA). The remaining 30% of cane sugar imports are largely sourced under the \u201cCXL\u201d quota. This is a quota that exists as a result of trade negotiations with countries that previously supplied countries that have subsequently joined the EU. Most of this sugar is subject to a \u20ac98 per tonne import duty. \n \nThe operation of the EU sugar market is governed by the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). Such has settled that in 2017 the beet producers will have no limits on quantity of prices to the sugar they produce our sell, while raw sugar refineries will be limited in quantities and import duties from preferential and other cane sugar suppliers.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+351)226 194 654"}
