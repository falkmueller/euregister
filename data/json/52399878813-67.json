Criminal justice systems that respect the rule of law, uphold the rights of suspects and defendants and prevent the unnecessary use of pre-trial detention. \n2. Fair and proportionate sentencing that takes account of the circumstances of both the offence and the offender. \n3. Humane treatment and conditions for prisoners and prevention of torture in all places of detention. \n4. Safer communities through rehabilitation, reintegration interventions and interventions to reduce re-offending. \n \nTo achieve our goals, we work as a catalyst for change through a smart mix of advocacy and practical programmes for reform. We work on four inter-connecting levels. \n \nWe advocate criminal justice reform at national, regional and international levels, engaging with governments, authorities and inter-governmental organisations. \nOur regional offices deliver practical programmes, often in partnership with local civil society partners, promoting and implementing human rights and international standards. \nWe develop and disseminate information and resources through our publications and this website. \nWe build the capacity of local civil society organisations to address penal reform in their work and give them a platform to raise human rights issues with authorities. \n \nOur current strategic plan covers priorities for 2015-2020 and is available at: https://www.penalreform.org/about-us/our-goals/", "industry_forums": "", "inter_groups": "", "number_of_persons_involved": "6", "relevant_communication": "Member of the civil society umbrella organisation, Human Rights and Democracy Network, based in Brussels.", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2017", "lat": 51.54391589999999, "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "0-9999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "3780620", "legal_status": "Non-governmental association registered in the Netherlands, and UK company", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Olivia Rope", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "Policy and Programme Manager", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+44)2079230946"}
