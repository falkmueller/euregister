All are invited - civil society organisations, businesses, media and political bodies.  \n \nLobbying - UE reaches out to Members of the European Parliament, the European Commission and national governments with aim of getting across our policy proposal and securing political support behind it. \n \nEngaging -  There is a strong economic case for Europe in our approach towards migration.

We place emphasis on the effects failed migration policies have had on businesses so far and aim at engaging the industry into European migration debate through organisation of conferences and public debates.", "financial_year_end_date": "01/01/2018", "lat": "50.8361551", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "0", "legal_status": "ASBL", "procurement": "", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "goals__remit": "Uphold Europe is a migration management focused pressure group founded as a response to the manifested inability of European leaders to agree on a common, sustainable and efficient solution for the European migration management crisis. \n \nWe work on four main policy areas: the Schengen System, the European External Border, the Asylum System, and the Economy of Migration", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+32)483680615"}
