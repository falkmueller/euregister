We do this by promoting the transparent, accountable and sustainable management of oil, gas and minerals so that they contribute to prosperity for all. \n \nWe engage at all stages of the extractive sector value chain to support research and promote training, learning and access to information by citizens. \n \nOur coalition is made up of more than 700 member organisations and 41 national coalitions across the world, including human rights, development, environmental and faith-based organisations. \n \nAll our members and coalitions have to adhere to Publish What You Pay\u2019s principles and standards. \n \nWe are guided by the belief that coordinating the collective actions, skills and interest of a diverse coalition of civil society organisations is the most effective way to influence key stakeholders and drive change in the extractive industries and the governmental sector. \n \nThe coalition is supported by a Secretariat and governed by various bodies, for more information visit our website.
