Many of these are large global players with installations in ports all over the world. Tank Storage Companies that are through their National Associations represented in FETSA combine close to 50 per cent of the world storage capacity in bulk liquids i.e. crude oil and oil products, chemicals, edible oils and fats and gases.It is FETSA's aim to contribute positively by offering information to policies that affect the tank storage business and are of general interest, like those that deal with the environment, safety, hazard prevention, logistics of dangerous [liquid] substances.", "industry_forums": "", "head_office_phone": "(+322)2389787", "level_of_interest": "European", "relevant_communication": "Yearly AGM, Conference 1 Exhibition, alternatively in other European (port)city.", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2017", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "0", "legal_status": "Non profit organisation under Belgian law", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Marc De Witte", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "Executive Director"}
