Agrobodies\u00ae have the advantage of acting directly and uniquely on the target organisms. As such, Agrobodies\u00ae combine a highly specific mode of action with a minimized risk of effects on wildlife, bees, growers and consumers.  \n \nAgrobodies\u00ae can be produced in a cost-effective manner by industrial-scale fermentation. The first generation of Agrobodies\u00ae protecting crops from fungal diseases is in the product development stage, while there are several complementary projects in the research phase.  \n \nAgroSavfe was established in January 2013 as a spin-off of VIB (Flanders Institute for Biotechnology), and is backed by a syndicate of renowned life sciences investors.
