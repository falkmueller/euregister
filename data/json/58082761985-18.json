{"member_organisations": "There are three categories of IUA membership which are outlined below: \n \nOrdinary \u2013 denotes full membership status with voting rights and an active involvement in the governance and operation of the association. Ordinary membership is open to international and wholesale insurance and reinsurance companies that hold a license from their domiciliary regulator to transact such business. In practice, most Ordinary members tend to operate in or through London.  \n \nAssociate \u2013 open to insurance and reinsurance companies outside London. Associate members may attend the association\u2019s annual general meeting, but have no voting rights. They receive a basic publication service.  \n \nAffiliate \u2013 introduced in January 2003 to cater for London market organisations who are either in run-off or who provide professional services to the association\u2019s Ordinary members. Affiliate membership confers no voting rights but offers the benefit of the IUA\u2019s information services. Affiliate members may also, where appropriate, take part in the IUA\u2019s committee activity. \n \nIUA Ordinary Member Companies - 52 \nAIG Europe Limited \nAllianz Global Corporate Specialty SE \nAllied World Assurance Company (Europe) Ltd \nArch Insurance Company (Europe) Limited \nAspen Insurance UK Limited \n-    Aspen Re UK \nAssicurazioni Generali S.p.A.
