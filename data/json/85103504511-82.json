Address the structural causes of violence against women and girls and secure women's economic justice \n \n2. Ensure increased civic participation and state accountability for the redistribution of resources and delivery of quality, gender-responsive public services \n \n3. Strengthen resilient livelihoods and secure climate justice \n \nIn the framework of the resilient livelihoods work, ActionAid EU office follows closely the EU development policy in the field of agriculture and food security. It is notably seeking to ensure that the implementation of the May 2014 Communication on the role of private sector in development includes adequate criteria and safeguards to ensure that the private sector effectively contributes to sustainable development and human rights. We also seek to ensure a strengthening of the rules on European financial institutions to avoid them being supportive of projects that end up being land grabs or further incentivise smallholder farmers' marginalisation.  \n \nIn the framework of the redistribution of resources workstream, ActionAid is following the initiatives announced by the European Commission in the field of taxation. Our objective is to try and ensure that the interests of developing countries are taken into account in the framework of the proposed reforms, so that they can strengthen their domestic resources, needed to pay for health, education and other gender-responsive public services. \n \nThroughout our work, we emphasise women\u2019s rights and the need for any EU policy to promote the rights of women and girls \u2013 this can range from the role of private sector in development to access to land.
