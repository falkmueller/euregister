We were co-created by a child\u2019s rights activist and leading business entrepreneurs in Sweden in 2009. We combine the best of the business and social sectors and believe entrepreneurship and innovation are equally important for start-ups in the social sector as for businesses. We find and support Change Leaders - local social entrepreneurs and help them to scale their innovations to solve the most pressing issues faced by children. Reach for Change operates as one organisation across several markets in Northern Europe, Central Europe and Kazakhstan and Africa. Our Global Board is responsible for setting the strategic direction of the organisation, and for managing risks, internal controls, oversights, set and approve budget as per their fiduciary responsibility and ensure the good governance. The foundation's operative work is lead by our CEO and a global management team, with representatives from our different regions and core functions. Key and distinct for our program implementation is that we have local knowledge and expertise of our markets. If we are to work with scaling social entrepreneurs and ensuring their impact on children, we do not only have to have the local knowledge and ownership of the social enterprise sector, we also have to have first-hand understanding of our target group - children and youth. Local knowledge is secured through local staff and locally executed programs. Reach for Change are present with around 65 staff members, working with committed partners and social entrepreneurs in 17 countries across Europe, Central Asia and Africa.  \nThe world needs new brave and smart solutions. We believe these solutions will come from people living close to the problem they are trying to solve. The Social entrepreneurs we support are passionate individuals with innovative solutions to the most pressing social problems faced by children. Rather than leaving children\u2019s needs and rights to the government or business sectors, our social entrepreneurs interact with children, find what is not working and solve the problem by changing the system, spreading the solution, and persuading entire societies to take new leaps. \nReach for Change currently works with more than 600 social entrepreneurs in 17 countries and have a pipeline of more than 10,000 ideas for social ventures. \nIn 2017, 465 social entrepreneurs were supported through Reach for Change\u2019s incubator and accelerator programs and 440 000 children and youth were positively impacted by the social entrepreneurs.  \nThe entrepreneurs address a wide range of pressing issues for children, e.g. education and health", "industry_forums": "", "head_office_phone": "(+46)86843100", "level_of_interest": "European, global, national, regional/local", "relevant_communication": "Event organized in Bulgaria autumn on Social Entrepreneurship to which commissioners and MEP will be invited.  \n \nWe also conduct an EU-funded project in Bulgaria.", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2017", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "0-9999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "5357550", "legal_status": "foundation", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Yuri Vulkovsky", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "Country Manager Bulgaria"}
