The two top priority objectives are (i) to have the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (hereinafter referred to as \u201cFCTC\u201d) implemented in Europe by 2020 and (ii) to reduce the prevalence of tobacco use in Europe to less than 5% by 2040. \n  \nENSP is governed by a General Assembly consisting of two representatives from each of the national coalitions against tobacco in Europe and of one representative from each of the specialised European tobacco control networks and individual member organisations. ENSP is administered by a regularly elected Executive Board which delegates the daily management and co-ordination of the network to a Secretariat in Brussels. \n  \nOur vision is of a future where our fellow Europeans will not suffer the distress of ill health and early death because of tobacco. We want our children to be able to grow up without being targeted with messages that seek to lure them into a lifetime of addiction. We want all Europeans to be able to breathe clean air unpolluted by tobacco smoke.  \nAs we increasingly communicate more freely and cross country borders more frequently, we realize that our individual countries do not stand alone; we feel the reverberations of change throughout Europe. Therefore, we undertake to use the best evidence of effectiveness in policy and practice to work together towards our common goal. \n \nThe activities that the Association conducts in order to attain its purpose are the following: \n- to focus in priority on coordination and consensus building, education, prevention and cessation; \n- to facilitate the creation and the development of national and international alliances for smoking prevention and tobacco control in Europe, as well as the support of their actions; \n- to promote collaboration amongst Member organizations and support their actions; \n- to stimulate and participate in joint projects at national and international level; \n- to undertake the collection, distribution and exchange of information relevant for tobacco control to the members of the Network, non-governmental organizations, intergovernmental organizations, national governments all over Europe and the institutions of the European Union; \n- to sponsor, promote and organize education and training seminars, conferences, missions, and exhibitions, on matters relevant to smoking and tobacco prevention and cessation.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+32)22306515"}
