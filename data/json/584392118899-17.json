Systembolaget exists for one reason and one reason only: alcohol-related problems are reduced if alcohol is sold in the absence of a profit motive. Systembolaget is expressly mandated to limit the harmful effects of alcohol. \n \nWe wish to inspire people to take an interest in what they drink and to focus on health and quality rather than quantity. And to use our expertise on our customer's behalf, both with regard to the taste characteristics of individual drinks and with regard to their effects on people's health. Our conviction is - the more people know, the better they will handle alcohol. \n \nFurther, Systembolaget's mandate from the Swedish state is to help limit the medical and social harm caused by alcohol and thereby improve public health. For Systembolaget this means: \n \n\u2022Restricting availability through the number of stores, opening hours and retail rules \n\u2022Not attempting to maximise our profit \n\u2022Not promoting additional sales \n\u2022Being brand-neutral \n\u2022Providing a high standard of customer service \n\u2022Being financially efficient", "industry_forums": "", "head_office_phone": "(+46)850330000", "level_of_interest": "national", "relevant_communication": "", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2016", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "0-9999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "0", "legal_status": "Aktiebolag", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Johan Lindblad", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "Bolagsjurist"}
