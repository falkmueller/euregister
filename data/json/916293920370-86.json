He often used to visit EU parliament to highlight the Kashmir issue by meeting MEPS, press conferences, Kashmir events organised by us and different human rights organisations.  \nWe continuously keep participating almost all events on Kashmir in the EU parliament since 2006. We along with Barrister Sultan Mahmood Chaudhry also had series of meetings with different MEPS and chairmen of different committees and delegates in the EU parliaWe urge European Union to invest serious and tangible diplomatic efforts including but not necessarily limited to sending a special envoy to the region. We believe that an appointment of a special envoy on Kashmir by the European Parliament to facilitate a dialogue between all parties concerned would go to a long way to hasten the progress of peace and reconciliation in the region of South Asia. \nDue to our continuous efforts and devotion on the issue, we believe the EU parliamentarians will play their positive role to resolve the 68-years old dispute to which India, Pakistan and the people of Kashmir are parties. \nAlso, in order for resolution of Kashmir dispute to be credible and lasting the leadership of the people of Jammu and Kashmir must be included in all future negotiations between India and Pakistan. The people of Kashmir want that EU parliament and officials should play their roles as a third party facilitation to make sure that the talks between India and Pakistan. The third party facilitator could be a person of an international standing to be appointed by the European Union to resolve this old Kashmir dispute. \nLast year on 27th October 2016  We organized a Protest on   Black Day  for Kashmiris when Indian Army entered in Kashmir since 27th october 1947.
