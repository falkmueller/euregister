This interdependence among variables demands that modern agriculture addresses a number of challenges: \n \nTo increase productivity to satisfy an ever-growing population; \nTo preserve the environment and climate; \nTo hold competiveness while acting in a global and liberalised marketplace. \nThe members of COCERAL are committed to respond to these challenges. To do so they must consider all elements influencing supply and demand, going far beyond the classic market indicators and market management measures. Other elements that influence supply and demand must be taken into consideration, such as: \n \nFood and feed safety issues; \nTrade agreements; \nCommon Agricultural Policy; \nEnvironmental and sustainability policies; \nBiofuel policy. \nThe coherence and synergies between all these elements are crucial to make agricultural markets work properly: these are \u201cour issues\u201d.  \n \nLow Level Presences (LLPs) \nMarket, Trade and Agricultural Policy \nInput to the Farming Community", "level_of_interest": "European", "organisation_name": "Comit\u00e9 du commerce des c\u00e9r\u00e9ales, aliments du b\u00e9tail, ol\u00e9agineux, huile d'olive, huiles et graisses et agrofournitures de l'U.E.
