It aims at representing and defending the interests of the farmhouse and artisan cheese and dairy sector, which is composed of businesses processing milk from cow, goat, buffalo and sheep, at a small-scale, and mostly, in the following two types of premises: \n \n-    \"Farmhouse\" premises, which belong to farms and which process milk from at least the majority of their own livestock according to traditional methods \n \n-    \"Artisan\" premises, which collect milk from local farmers and process it in small structures according to traditional methods \n \nIn both cases, they generally enter in the definition of \u201cmicroenterprises\u201d, according to Commission Recommendation C(2003) 1422. They are family businesses, which make locally recognized products based on traditional, specific know-how. These businesses are economically profitable and are often a major support for difficult rural territories where dairy farming is one of the only possible activities. \n \nFACEnetwork and it members organisations aim at preserving, developing and promoting the diversity and richness of farmhouse and artisanal cheeses in Europe. FACEnetwork is the \u201cspokesperson\u201d for farmhouse and artisanal cheese-makers at European level: \nrecognizing that European legislation may have an impact, whether positive or negative, on the activities of its members, FACEnetwork is committed to follow the relevant activities of the European institutions to ensure that its sector\u2019s interests are taken into account.

This project was funded by the European Commission, and it resulted in a Community guide pursuant to article 9 of Regulation (EC) N\u00b0852/2004 on the hygiene foodstuffs.
