We use the power of video for community mobilisation and advocacy campaigning. Our vision is of a society where policies affecting vulnerable communities are evidence-informed and respect human rights, as well as developed and implemented with the meaningful involvement of these communities. The main focus of our work is on people who use drugs, sex workers and people who live with HIV, but we are glad to work with other stigmatised communities, such as LMBTQ people, ethnic minorities, migrants, refugees and homeless people. Our mission is to educate the public about the role of evidence in policy formulation, to provide a voice for vulnerable communities, and to improve the advocacy efforts of NGOs by providing technical assistance and training. The RRF team is based in Budapest, and most of our activities focus on Europe, but we have cooperated with a number of NGOs beyond Europe, from New Zealand to Canada, from Mexico to Indonesia.", "industry_forums": "", "head_office_phone": "(+3620)4025243", "level_of_interest": "global", "relevant_communication": "The director of RRF made a major contribution to the current EU Action Plan on Drugs: http://drogriporter.hu/en/eu_ap/", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2017", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "0-9999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "207513", "legal_status": "foundation", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "P\u00e9ter S\u00e1rosi", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "Executive Director"}
