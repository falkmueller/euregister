Its statue embraces the principles set out in the World Conservation Strategy (IUCN, UNEP, WWF, 1981), Agenda 21 and the Rio Declaration. \n \nIt supports science-based solutions, full stakeholder participation, due consideration for the socio-economic aspects and for cultural diversity. \n \nEBCD aims at: \n  Achieving a balance between the need to conserve nature and the need for economic growth. \n  Ensuring that conservation/ management decisions are based on the best available scientific advice. \n  Ensuring that any utilisation of natural resources is sustainable, both biologically and socially. \n  Ensuring full stakeholder participation in decision making process. \n  Raising awareness of the principles and problem solving methods for sustainable production, use and consumption. \n \nIn the International arena, EBCD follows closely environmental agreements and conventions such as CBD, CITES, UNFCCC etc. Working in full collaboration with the European institutions, EBCD monitors EU developments on environmental policy with the main focus on marine and fisheries issues and it provides advice to policy makers and stakeholders. \n \nHaving worked with the European Parliament for over 25 years, EBCD provides the Secretariat of the European Parliament Intergroup \u201cClimate Change, Biodiversity and Sustainable Development\u201d. This Intergroup, being the biggest and the most active in the EP, constitutes a cross-party, cross-committee and cross-sectoral platform for Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) to learn, discuss and create policies geared towards finding solutions to issues related to sustainable development with main focus on climate change and biodiversity. \n \nBesides the Intergroup, EBCD organises high level seminars and workshops. Mainly focused on marine and fisheries issues, they bring together all the players seeking to find balanced solutions. \n \nAs an active member of International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) since its establishment, EBCD works closely with its network of experts, Commissions and Programmes as well as with other organisations and institutions actively involved in the conservation of biodiversity and sustainable management of natural renewable resources.
