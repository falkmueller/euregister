Laws produced by elected bodies and officials within the framework of a democratic constitutional State must be consistently applied by an independent judiciary to all natural and legal persons alike in order to guarantee civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights and liberties. \nB&S Europe shares these principles and values with external aid beneficiaries (mainly the European Commission) and with our ever-growing network of specialized experts around the globe. To ensure an efficient work and a good coverage of all areas of interventions and possibilities, we are divided into different working groups: governance, justice, security. Moreover, the sectors covered by the working groups as well as our tailored approach are: civil society, communication and events, democracy and governance, regional development, rule of law, security and social affairs. \nEach working group is following all EU policies and directives that tackle global challenges in the context of the EU external actions, in order to be able to implement our projects in the most efficient way possible.

Indeed, the bulk of our work consists of projects funded by the European Commission in the sectors of security, good governance and justice. \nIn security and defense, B&S Europe has been implementing projects to support relevant actors in modernizing their organisation, developing their capacities and to support the improvement and consolidation of relevant legal framework. In all our projects, we aim at mainstreaming security while complying with international human rights standards and EU best practices in the relevant fields. Indeed, we are currently involved in fighting against organized crime and corruption in Kosovo and FYROM, supporting the Police and Security Sector Reform in Guinea or the EU Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) Centres of Excellence in Uzbekistan and Algeria.  In the justice sector reform, we have projects ranging from the support for effective and efficient functioning of the judiciary to the reinforce of institutional capacity for administration of justice at Ministerial, regional and local levels. We are implementing projects in justice in Honduras, Guinea, Togo, Chad, Burkina Faso, Jamaica, Kosovo and Serbia. Finally, we are involved in the reconciliation project in Cyprus to support civil society from both communities. \nMoreover, B&S Europe avails itself of a specific events and communication department, through which we take action on organizing events of different typologies on behalf of the European Commission on themes related to human rights and development.
