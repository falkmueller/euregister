Quality, involvement and clarity underpin our \neducational approach. \n \nTo provide world-class academic research \n \nAt Radboud University we create a lively, successful \nresearch community, generating new insights and \nideas which contribute to social, cultural and economic \ndevelopment across the full spectrum of our academic \ndisciplines, both nationally and internationally. Research \nfeeds back into education; this close connection between \neducation and research is the most important aspect of \nour pursuit of excellence. \n \nResearch quality \n \n\u2022 The research at the University is trend-setting internationally, and this is reflected in good \nscores for fundraising and publications in high-impact-factor journals. \n\u2022 All research (following the new Standard Evaluation Protocol for assessments of scientific \nresearch in the Netherlands) is evaluated as at least \u2018very good\u2019; research groups that do not \nmeet this standard are phased out. \n\u2022 The University creates scope for excellent, curiosity-driven research. \n\u2022 Our academic infrastructure and research data are made available to other knowledgeintensive \norganisations. \n\u2022 ICT facilities for researchers are sufficiently robust: \n\u25ca Our Research Data Management (RDM) programme and rollouts of digital scientific \ninformation have been completed. \n\u25ca Research systems such as RDM/RDS, Metis, and the Radboud Repository have been \nintegrated, in order to create a coherent environment for saving, sharing and unlocking \nresearch information and data.  \n \nSocietal Impact \n \nWe are intensifying our collaboration \nwith a range of social partners. There is \nincreasing demand from society \u2013 as well \nas political pressure \u2013 for research results \nto be useful socially and economically. \nFewer investments in scientific research \nare being made by the business community, \nwhile the government is encouraging a shift \nfrom public to private funding in higher \neducation. Universities are competing \nintensively to secure collaboration with \nprivate partners. Given the financial \nimportance of such collaborations, issues \nsuch as the need to avoid possible conflicts \nof interest, legal liability and reputation \nmanagement are coming into sharper focus.", "industry_forums": "", "head_office_phone": "(+31)243611427", "level_of_interest": "European, global, national, regional/local", "relevant_communication": "", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2016", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "50000-99999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "543922000", "legal_status": "foundation", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Wilfried Reincke", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "EU Liaison"}
