COMECE is formed by the Bishops' Conferences of the European Union's Member states. \n \nThe COMECE Secretariat, as a Church representation, fully supports the goal of bringing greater transparency to the legislative and policy-making process at the EU level, as an important element of a democratic and pluralistic society, and for this reason and in this spirit entered the present registration system in 2011. However, it also advocates for a re-balancing of the burden of transparency, currently placed more on citizens and organisations, rather than on public officials. Furthermore, the risk of exclusion of actors that enjoy no \"formal status\" (e.g. migrants, the elderly, the poor, Roma people, informal youth groups, social movements), due to the lack of specific provisions to allow for access to decision-makers, is a source of concern.  \n \nWe recognise ourselves in the definition of \u2018Organisations representing churches and religious communities\u2019, as contained in the 2014 Agreement between the European Parliament and the European Commission on the transparency register for organisations and self-employed individuals engaged in EU policy-making and policy implementation (\u201cLegal entities, offices or networks set up for representation activities\u201d). We also fully support the idea that the register does not apply to Churches themselves, as specified in the Agreement. \n \nHowever, we would like to emphasise that the lobbying and/or interest representation terminology (still used in a generalised way e.g. in the introductory sentence to the Code of Conduct; in various passages of the \u2018Guidelines\u2019 document; and in the Proposal for an Interinstitutional Agreement on a mandatory Transparency Register) cannot be applied to us as a Church representation.  \n \nOn the basis of Article 17(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), we are involved in Dialogue with the EU institutions as a representation of a Church entity, having a specific contribution to make to the common good and a peculiar identity, status and dignity, not as a lobby group or interest representative or single-issue organisation. We see our contribution as being mainly of a moral and ethical nature, but also rooted within the Social Doctrine of the Church. This contribution is constantly inspired by the Gospel and by the Catholic Church\u2019s reflection on the dignity of each human being as created in God\u2019s image. We operate in search of the common good, not in the name of \u2018business\u2019 or \u2018interests\u2019 (as typical features of lobbying and interest representation). Finally, we are not conditioned by third-parties' interests. \n \nCOMECE emphasises that registrations under Section V of the Transparency Register should be consistent with the binding formulation of Article 17 TFEU. Therefore, registration in the present Section should concern only \"organisations representing\" the actors described in Article 17, paragraph 1 TFEU.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+32)2 235 05 10"}
