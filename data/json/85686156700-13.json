The EWL currently consists of member organisations in all 28 EU Member States and three of the five official-candidate countries as well as 20 European-wide member organisations working on very diverse areas and activities. The EWL represents an overall of more than 2000 organisations.  \n \nThe EWL works towards a vision of a peaceful, social and democratic European Union built on a culture of respect for human rights, equality, peace and solidarity, in Europe and globally, where women and men have equal rights, full enjoyment of their personal integrity and choice, an equal share of social, cultural and economic resources, caring and family roles, and are equally represented in decision making. \n \nWe believe in a Feminist Europe. We want a holistic, transformational socioeconomic vision, based on well-being, equality, social justice, and a powerful voice against women\u2019s poverty. We envision a culture in which \nwomen enjoy equal rights and participation in reimagined power and decision-making structures, in which all forms of violence against women has been eliminated, and women have been liberated from all forms of oppression. We envision a society in which women\u2019s contribution to all aspects of life is recognised, rewarded and celebrated - in leadership, in care and in \nproduction; all women have freedom of choice, self-confidence, and freedom from exploitation; and no woman has been left behind. \n \nWe are a credible source of expertise and experience on women\u2019s rights and equality between women and men, representing the diversity of the women\u2019s movement across the European Union. We represent an inclusive, \nconfident, loud, independent feminist voice and bring real women\u2019s voices into the EU political arena. We build consensus and mobilise our members\u2019 collective experience to work on major issues affecting women, to realise women\u2019s rights, equality between women and men and social justice. We act as a catalyst connecting different actors and organisations to bring change at EU \nlevel. \n \nWe work together with our members at predominantly the European but also the national level in order to achieve equality between women and men in all areas of public and private life; actively address issues of economic and social justice and independence for women; work towards the equal representation of women and men in decision-making, and safeguarding women\u2019s human rights including the eradication of male violence against women.  \n \nThe EWL functions within democratic, open and transparent procedures of communication, decision-making and accountability, including financial accountability.  \n \nThe European Women\u2019s Lobby monitors and inputs into important political processes at the European Union level, which are relevant for women\u2019s rights including those policy adaptations and innovations required by the radical economic and social changes of the national, EU and world context. We aim to reflect the intersectional nature of women\u2019s needs, in all their diversity, in order for these to be addressed and mainstreamed into all policies and all aspects of socio-political and economic life, and we politically advocate for a dual approach combining specific measures for women\u2019s rights and thorough transformative gender mainstreaming. In our work we will also insist on critically challenging culturally inherited gender stereotypes, and the images detrimental to gender equality between women and men we are confronted with in different ways on a daily basis, and make political interventions as relevant.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+32)2179020"}
