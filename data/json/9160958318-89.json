From the launch in 2009 of proposals for the regulation of OTC derivatives we have acted as a catalyst for the views of the corporate sector in Europe. Our objective is to ensure that through formal response to consultations and proposals, as well as informal contact with all relevant EU institutions, proper account is taken of the likely real economy impact of regulation of the financial sector. \n \nImplementation of SEPA: we have contributed both at \nEuropean level \u2013 participating in stakeholders\u2019 meetings, SEPA progress reviews, consultations and expert groups of the EC, European Parliament, ECB and EPC, in working groups with the EPC for Direct Debits and Remittance Information \u2013 and at national level, with many associations that are members of the EACT involved in their national SEPA Migration Committees.
