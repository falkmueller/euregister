In particular, the Directive sets minimum national targets for the collection of waste portable batteries and the minimum performance of recycling facilities. The Directive restricts the use of some hazardous substances and requires that users be properly informed of these products\u2019 characteristics. \n  \nThe evaluation is the first step of a review process, in which the Commission assesses whether the Directive meets its objectives and contributes to the general objectives of the EU environmental policy.", "organisation_name": "Uni\u00f3n de Industrias de la Bateria, S.L.
