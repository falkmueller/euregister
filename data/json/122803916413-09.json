{"member_organisations": "The SIOPE membership is based on the European National Paediatric Haemato-Oncology Societies or groups (\u2018NaPHOS\u2019), which encourage their members to become part of the SIOPE network. In countries without NaPHOS, medical institutions and treatment centres specialised in paediatric cancer care can join SIOPE. Such centres can allow the paediatric haemato-oncology professionals in their institute to also become members of SIOPE. To ensure an open and continuously growing community, oncology professionals who are not members of a NaPHOS can also join SIOPE. \n \nMembers contribute an annual membership fee of EUR 20.  \n \nList of members: http://www.siope.eu/about-siope/members/", "identification_number": "122803916413-09", "fields_of_interest": "Justice and Fundamental Rights, Research and innovation, Public Health", "head_office_address": "Avenue E.
