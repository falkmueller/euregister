RISE has approximately 20 network members from 14 different European countries. Each country is represented by a national contact point. The network members have different educational and professional background. Rise represents the authentic voices of refugees, where refugees campaign for themselves. The RISE network aims at reducing discrimination and prejudices towards refugees by deconstructing \nold narratives on refugees and creating new \nperceptions in societies. The ultimate goal of RISE is that refugees will have a decent life in Europe as full \nmember of the society, self-determined and recognized as human beings with skills, experiences, ideas and thoughts. \n \nGFR Working group: The working group of GFR composed by representatives of refugee communities followed precisely the last national and European policy developments and the refugee situation in Greece. This monitoring allowed the group to write statements and press releases based on the direct impact that these developments have on refugee lives. Due to our ground expertise, we could identify practical issues that the refugees may meet and also, as a consequence, advocate - by considering what is best for refugees", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2017", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "1104503", "legal_status": "association", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "YONOUS MUHAMMADI", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "PRESIDENT"}
