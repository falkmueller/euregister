We were founded in 1994.  Our main office is in Washington, DC, USA.  Our mission is to conceptualize, develop, and implement public policies that will keep the Internet open, innovative and free.  Our main issues are consumer privacy (including privacy of electronic health records), free expression, security and surveillance (including cybercrime and cybersecurity), Internet openness, and intellectual property.  Our goals include adoption of comprehensive baseline standards for consumer privacy, robust protection of online free expression, the establishment of reasonable limits on government surveillance, and the protection of Internet intermediaries from liability for the conduct of their users.  We seek to promote dialogue and consensus-building among stakeholders, with the aim of developing balanced solutions to the policy challenges of the Information Society.  We conduct research and produce reports on policy issues affecting the Internet, contribute to the development of technical standards, promote the adoption of industry best practices that will empower consumers, and participate in government policymaking processes.  Globally, we collaborate with Internet policy activists working to protect and enhance human rights.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+1)2026379800"}
