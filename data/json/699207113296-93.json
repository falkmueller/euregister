In 2017, they worked on more than 380 national and international projects in the following fields: chemicals management and technology assessment; energy and climate; emission and radiation protection; agriculture and biodiversity; sustainability in consumption, mobility, resource management and companies; nuclear technology and plant safety as well as law, politics and governance. \nBased on value-oriented scientific research, the \u00d6ko-Institut advises decision-makers from politics, business and civil society. Since its foundation, the institute has been working interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary - with partners from business, science and civil society - in cooperative projects and network structures, where this makes sense in terms of questions. \nThe most important clients include federal and state ministries, companies and the European Union.
