With over 125 member organisations in more than 27 European countries, CAN Europe unites to work to prevent dangerous climate change and promote sustainable energy and environment policy in Europe. \n \nThe Climate Action Network (CAN) is a worldwide network of over 750 Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) working to promote government, private sector and individual action to limit human-induced climate change to ecologically sustainable levels. CAN is based on trust, openness and democracy. \n \nThe vision of CAN is a world striving actively towards and achieving the protection of the global climate in a manner that promotes equity and social justice between peoples, sustainable development of all communities, and protection of the global environment. CAN unites to work towards this vision. \n \nCAN's mission is to support and empower civil society organisations to influence the design and development of an effective global strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and ensure its implementation at international, national and local levels in the promotion of equity and sustainable development. \n \nCAN Europe is committed to transparency about EU interest  \nrepresentation. CAN Europe believes that this register fails basic transparency standards and that it does not provide EU lobbying transparency.  \n \nWhen registering, we have therefore chosen to give all relevant information that we consider necessary for lobbying transparency. A credible EU lobbying transparency register should include names of individual lobbyists and the issues that they try to influence, provide precise and comparable financial information on lobbying, and have effective sanctions to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information disclosed. In an effort to arrive at a more objective way of calculating lobbying expenditures, we follow guidelines that result from consultations with public interest organisations, professionals working on lobby transparency as well as experts of US lobby disclosure legislation. Our registration is therefore providing a more comprehensive calculation of our expenses for activities that aim to influence the policy formulation and decision-making processes of the European institutions, and a list of those who, on behalf of CAN Europe, carry out such activities.   \n  \nOur registration is based on the guidelines for transparent registration developed by the Civil Society Contact Group and ALTER-EU.
