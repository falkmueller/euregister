We are a UK-based charity that gathers together the brightest young leaders from around the world, empowering them to make lasting connections to create positive change. \n \nWe stage an annual Summit where the most valuable young talent from global and national companies, NGOs, universities and other forward-thinking organisations are joined by world leaders, acting as the One Young World Counsellors. \n \nAt the Summit, delegates debate, formulate and share innovative solutions for the pressing issues the world faces. \n \nAt past Summits delegates were joined by a line-up of Counsellors that included Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu, Sir Bob Geldof, Kofi Annan, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Professor Muhammad Yunus, Emma Watson, Jack Dorsey and Arianna Huffington. \n \nTo date One Young World Summits have been held in:  \n \n2010 - London, UK \n2011 - Zurich, Switzerland \n2012 - Pittsburgh, USA \n2013 - Johannesburg, South Africa \n2014 - Dublin, Ireland \n2015 - Bangkok, Thailand \n2016 - Ottawa, Canada \n2017 - Bogota, Colombia \n \nAfter each Summit, the delegates, who are then known as One Young World Ambassadors, work on their own initiatives or lend the power of the One Young World network to those initiatives already in existence. Of those in employment, many return to their companies and set about creating change from within, energising their corporate environment. \n \nThe Ambassador community is supported by a dedicated One Young World team whose mission is to maximise the benefits each Ambassador is able to draw from the network. Services they provide include:  \n \n- Creating and connecting Ambassadors with opportunities to further their work and development post-Summit. Opportunities range from grants to speaking engagements. \n \n- Making fruitful connections between Ambassadors to share skills and best practice to further their work. \n \n- Highlighting and raising awareness of Ambassador initiatives through One Young World\u2019s online platforms and mainstream media outreach. \n \n- Coordinating local events to give Ambassadors the opportunity to meet and network in between Summits.  \n \n- Involving Ambassadors in One Young World\u2019s Global Consultation Process, which is used to define the agenda of each Summit, thereby ensuring that the event is a true reflection of the Ambassador community which it serves.", "industry_forums": "", "head_office_phone": "(+44)2036918060", "level_of_interest": "global", "relevant_communication": "Since mid-2017, One Young World has been running an initiative supported by the European Commission entitled 'Empowering Youth for Positive Change'. The initiative has been designed to complement and support the priorities of the Instrument contributing to \nStability and Peace by empowering young people to contribute to countering violent extremism, conflict prevention and peacebuilding in their communities. As part of this project, One Young World has sourced and appointed 80 'Peace Ambassadors' from developing countries to take part in the One Young World Summit 2017 in Bogota, Colombia, built a dedicated area for the sponsored young leaders on the One Young World website, fostered dialogue and shaped debate around the key themes of their engagement through on-line tools, ensured communications and media coverage around the programme and facilitated participation of the young leaders in other relevant peace & security-related events. \n \nBuilding on our collaboration with the European Commission throughout 2017 and 2018, One Young World has proposed to continue its efforts to empower young leaders from developing countries to counter and prevent violent extremism and conflict in their local communities. The proposed new programme of work will raise awareness of the issues of conflict and violent extremism and its youth-led solutions through enhanced on-line and off-line communications and advocacy throughout the twelve-month period.  \n \nOne Young World would like to connect the newly selected young leaders to Extremely Together, a countering violent extremism (CVE) initiative led by the Kofi Annan Foundation and supported by European Commission funding, to explore options for training and collaboration. One Young World has supported the Extremely Together project as a delivery partner.  \n \nEfforts to create the above collaboration 'Empowering Youth for Positive Change' have involved contacting staff of EU institutions. Specifically our staff have had contact with Jesper Pedersen, Head of Division Unit for Instrument for Stability of the European Commission and Irena Andrassy, Deputy Head of Cabinet for European Commissioner for International Cooperation and Development  \n \nLastly, One Young World is involved in an organisational capacity with the European Development Days 2018 organised by the European Commission, which will be taking place on 5 and 6 June 2018. \n\u2003", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2017", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "200000-299999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "4926382", "legal_status": "Charity", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Katherine Robertson", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "Co-founder"}
