Our permanent project \u201cBe Ready 4 EU\u201d  responds to the question: \"Are u ready 4 European Union?\". The aim of Project \"Be ready 4 EU\" is to make young people aware of the meaning of being a European citizen. \nIn fact we engage young citizens in civic volunteering, encouraging them to have their say on EU affairs, also favouring and encouraging contacts with European policy makers, asking them to take in consideration the youth opinion. They also be encouraged to express their own opinion as observers and citizens and make it known to the decision makers. So, joining the debate young EU citizens will better understand the real meaning of the EU democracy.  \n \nThe participants are engaged in a strong communication campaign which is focused on the central message to \"be ready for the EU\", addressing as target group other young people. Our communication strategy is based on the methodology based on \"youth to youth communication\".  \n \nOn our blog, the main EU debates (from the European Parliament representing the citizens directly) are reported in a clear and comprehensive language for young EU citizens who knows little about the EU issues. \nWe also stimulate the contacts with MEPs in a way to get them closer to the citizens (here you can find a sample: http://www.europe-hopes.eu/News/art/9/belgian-liberal-mep-philippe-de-backer-optimistic-about-europes-future-despite-atmosphere-of-crisis)  \n \nIn summary during the years 2014-2015 our activities have had two specific objectives:1)improving the offer of communication on EU affairs for the European young citizens;2)empowering young citizens, encouraging their participation within the EU debates.  \n \nIt is worth remarking our main outcomes of 2016: \n \nPartners of the Erasmus+ KA1 project \"Step out of your mind) Lead Association Prorise Spain. \n \nFacilitator and training provider for the KA3 project.

Naz. Giovani). \n \n- Our \"Be Ready 4 EU\" session in Brussels (november-dicember) permitted to a group of 10 young people to have their say on EU matters and contacting and interviewing some MEPs  or members of the Commission. More than this our activities have had the merit to reach more than new 1500 readers and interactions through our blog and the other social media.  \n \n- On dicember 4th we have held a relevant round-table \"Terrorism in the EU. What are the effects of the latest Paris attacks on the EU policies?\", with which we have stimulated young people to have their say on the matter. A position paper will be published within january 2016 (key messages on twitter: @europehopes). \n \nIn the following years 2016-2017 we will enforce our advocacy activity focused on youth rights with a deeper commitment in proposing new tools (or developing the existing ones) aimed to streghten the civic participation of the young european citizens.
