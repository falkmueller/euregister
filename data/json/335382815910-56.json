We do this through significant and ongoing interaction with the member organisations from UK, Netherlands, Poland, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Spain, France, Italy, Sweden, Cyprus and Croatia. On the basis of information and advice received in this way we generate policy views and transit them to the Commission [DG MARE], MEP's and Member States. LIFE has already had a number of successful meetings with these elements that have provided a much clearer understanding of the sector and the benefits it provides to often remote and vulnerable coastal communities. \nWe undertake events such as conferences and more local meetings in member states in support of our organisations therein, assist them in capacity building and work closely with them in regard to their relationships with regional and national governments. \nAs LIFE is a new organisation and is still very much in development, we have yet to create a website or any publications for external interests. We have a Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Low-Impact-Fishers-of-Europe/166393173503352?ref=hl but at present we are focusing more on practical requirements rather than social media. \nWe attend meetings and conferences where we are able to promote the benefits of small scale, low impact fishing. \nIn partnership with our member organisations across Europe, we are encouraging other smaller scale fishing organisations to join us. We have a number of organisations interested in joining LIFE that will assist greatly in providing added credibility to our aims and ambitions on behalf of our sector.", "financial_year_end_date": "01/04/2017", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "400000-499999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "0", "legal_status": "Private Company Limited by Guarantee", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Jeremy Percy", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "Executive Director"}
