It aims to inform policymakers and the public about cruelty to animals and promote an understanding of the right of all animals to be treated with respect. \n \nThe group works through public education, research, legislation, special events, celebrity involvement, and protest campaigns. It believes in non-violence and does not advocate or support actions in which anyone, human or non-human, is harmed. \n \nAs a member of the PETA International Science Consortium Ltd., PETA UK promotes reliable and relevant regulatory testing approaches that protect human health and the environment while eliminating the use of animals. It works with industry, academics, and regulatory bodies to promote and fund non-animal research methods and regularly submits detailed scientific and policy-driven comments on a wide range of consultations involving animal-protection issues. \n \nThe group also has active programmes that aim to prevent animals from being abused for food, clothing, entertainment, or any other purpose. As a result of its work, numerous companies have pledged not to use fur, leather, or other animal-derived materials in their products or made other changes to benefit animals, as have many individuals. It has also provided information to help secure convictions for cruelty-to-animals offences and has driven forward improved animal-protection legislation.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+44)02078376327"}
