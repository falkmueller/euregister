We do this by means of our publications that carry the results of product comparison tests, wide coverage on surveys, concrete and useful advice to single out the best quality versus price ratio and the most profitable opportunities for consumers, thereby enabling the latter to be in a position to choose, negotiate, avoid mistakes or swindles and to protect themselves.  \n \n \nALTROCONSUMO wants the voice of consumers to be heard by national and international institutions responsible for the decisions made on issues regarding aspects of the consumer\u2019s daily life and actively takes part in a great number of hearings, meetings and committees, both Italian and international, dealing with consumer problems. \nThrough press releases, press conferences, TV and radio programs, our activity is publicised with the general public. Mass media are often a useful ally in making people aware, on a local, domestic and international level. \n \nALTROCONSUMO is committed to transparency about EU interest representation. ALTROCONSUMO believes that this register fails basic transparency standards and that it does not provide EU lobbying transparency. When registering, we have therefore chosen to give all relevant information that we consider necessary for lobbying transparency. A credible EU lobbying transparency register should include names of individual lobbyists and the issues that they try to influence, provide precise and comparable financial information on lobbying, and have effective sanctions to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information disclosed. In an effort to arrive at a more objective way of calculating lobbying expenditures, we follow guidelines that result from consultations with public interest organisations, professionals working on lobby transparency as well as experts of US lobby disclosure legislation. Our registration is therefore providing a more comprehensive calculation of our lobbying expenses, and a list of those who, on behalf of ALTROCONSUMO, carry out activities with the objective of influencing the policy formulation and decision-making processes of the European institutions.  \n \nOur registration is based on the guidelines for transparent registration developed by the Civil Society Contact Group and ALTER-EU ( which can be accessed at: http://www.act4europe.org/register)", "industry_forums": "", "head_office_phone": "(+02)668901", "level_of_interest": "European, national, regional/local", "relevant_communication": "4-5-6.12.2017 Bruxelles - \"EU Trade policy - what it is, why it matters\" (DG TRADE \u2013 EU) \n \n5.12 Sofia - Meeting of minister Alexander Manolev with BEUC representatives \n \nMiles 21- project funded by LIFE+ PROGRAMME", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2016", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "5000000-5249999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "5839606", "legal_status": "Non profit and private association", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Luisa Crisigiovanni", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "Segretario Generale"}
