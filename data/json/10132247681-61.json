We do so through science, global conservation, education and the management of the world's largest system of urban wildlife parks, led by the flagship Bronx Zoo. Together these activities change attitudes towards nature and help people imagine wildlife and humans living in harmony. WCS is committed to this mission because it is essential to the integrity of life on Earth. \n  \nDuring our 115 years, we have forged the power of our global conservation work and the management of our five parks in New York City to create the world\u2019s most comprehensive conservation organization. We currently manage about 500 conservation projects in more than 60 countries; and educate millions of visitors at our five living institutions in New York City on important issues affecting our planet. Our parks include: the Bronx Zoo, New York Aquarium, Central Park Zoo, Prospect Park Zoo and Queens Zoo. \n \nWith a commitment to protect 25 percent of the world\u2019s biodiversity, we address four of the biggest issues facing wildlife and wild places: climate change; natural resource exploitation; the connection between wildlife health and human health; and the sustainable development of human livelihoods. While taking on these issues, we manage more than 200 million acres of protected lands around the world, with more than 200 scientists on staff. \n \nWCS operates country programs throughout four continents\u2014Africa, Asia, Latin America, and North America\u2014to save the last of the wild.", "industry_forums": "", "head_office_phone": "(+1 718)220 5100", "level_of_interest": "global", "relevant_communication": "", "financial_year_end_date": "01/06/2017", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "100000-199999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "249492905", "legal_status": "US based charity - branch office in Brussels", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Janice  Weatherley-Singh", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "Director of European Policy & Government Relations"}
