A major focus is on optimising the impact and exploitation of knowledge and ideas. There is a great wealth of publicly funded academic research waiting to be turned into products, services and solutions that create market value benefitting the economy and society. \n \nOur activities are mainly taking place in the environment of the EU institutions with a strong foothold in the European Parliament. Within the activities of the K4I Forum in the European Parliament, supported by 40 MEPs, we have been organising more than 500 debates and 9 successful European Innovation Summit events in the European Parliament in Brussels. \n \n.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+32)22335451"}
