President Macron picked up this idea in his Speech on Europe at the Sorbonne last year and announced the creation of such an agency, followed by Chancellor Merkel in June 2018. \nJEDI represents both Europe\u2019s civil society and its Deeptech-Ecosystem. We already unite the 120 leading technology corporations, start-ups, venture capitalists and research institutions in Germany and France today.
