UNIPI is committed to promoting high-quality research and teaching in all fields of knowledge and to opening its programmes to an ever more increasing number of international students and researchers. Accordingly, it leads important international research and education networks, ensuring the integration of scientific findings into its graduate and post-graduate programmes. At the Italian level, in the international ranking of universities published by the Times Higher Education 2019, the University of Pisa ranks in the range between 8th and 11th place, out of a total of 43 institutions surveyed, confirming its position as the first among the generalist universities in Tuscany. The Departments of Information Engineering and of Civilisatios and Forms of Knowledge of the University, moreover, have recently obtained from the Italian Ministry of Research an important recognition, so-called Department of Excellence, for the quality of research and management of research activities. The quality of the research of the University of Pisa is also attested by a significant number of research projects funded by the European Framework Programmes (157 in FP7, and 97 so far in H2020), and in particular by the n. 8 ERC projects funded in FP7 and in Horizon 2020, in different research fields. Since 2017, UNIPI has strengthened its strategy to increase excellence in research and international competitiveness within the European and international scenario, by further developing its networking and lobbying activities at the EU level, launching specific actions and incentives and reinforcing the support services of its European and International Research Service.
