By working with mainstream companies which buy raw materials in large volumes, we can improve the standard of living of as many farmers as possible at a high pace. \n \nUTZ is convinced that increasing sustainability should also reinforce the independent position of farmers. This is why farmers are trained in the professionalization of their agricultural practice and operational management. This improves the quality of their products and allows them to produce higher volumes at lower costs. This in turn enables the farmers to negotiate a better price for a better product and to improve their standard of living. Moreover, farmers who work with UTZ in the global marketplace receive a premium for their crop and they don\u2019t have to pay for taking part in the program. \n \nBy working with a Code of Conduct, UTZ sets requirements for the farmers when it comes to the sustainable growing of coffee, cocoa, tea and hazelnuts. Farmers are trained in the area of business skills, labor conditions and environmental management and their operational management is checked by independent third parties. The UTZ tracking system subsequently insures that the raw materials have actually been grown and harvested in a responsible manner. \n \nWe want to achieve sustainable agricultural supply chains, where: \n\u2013 Farmers are professionals implementing good practices; \n\u2013 The food industry takes responsibility by demanding and rewarding sustainable production; \n\u2013 Consumers can trust their brands and buy products which meet their expectations  \n \nUTZ\u2019s field support, traceability system and certification enables markets to reward good practices. \n \nUTZ is currently in a merger process with the Rainforest Alliance to combine our strengths because of the urgent imperative to scale up and accelerate sustainable transformation to meet those challenges.", "industry_forums": "", "head_office_phone": "(+31)205308000", "level_of_interest": "global", "relevant_communication": "", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2017", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "0-9999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "25362395", "legal_status": "Foundation", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Frederik de Vries", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "Partnership manager"}
