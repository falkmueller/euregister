This software is an enhancement of a platform deployed at a major regulated exchange since 2012.  \nHad AlgoGuard been in use on US exchanges in 2010 it should have prevented all the algorithms which have been identified as majorly responsible for the flash crash from ever having traded in live markets. \nOur main motivation is to make the markets safer, fairer and less likely to be subject to more restrictive legislation in the future.
