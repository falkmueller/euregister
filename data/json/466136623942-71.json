More than 50 representatives of ministries, funding organisations, research and industry from EU and non-EU countries and the European Commission, have participated in a networking cocktail to welcome the official start of ERA-MIN 2. \nOn the morning of the 2nd December 2016, the ERA-MIN 2 Advisory Board discussed the topics of the upcoming call with the funding organisations in 5 working groups to better align the national/regional priorities with the research and industrial needs. In the afternoon session, the funding organisations discussed and streamlined the implementation of the ERA-MIN Joint Call 2017.  \nERA-MIN 2 has published the EU co-funded joint call for transnational R&I projects on 1st February 2017 with a total budget of 15 million Euro and participation of 13 EU countries/regions and 4 non-EU countries. \n94 project ideas were submitted involving academia-industry partnerships and 27% participation of enterprises. \nThe scope of the Joint Call was demand-driven research and innovation on primary and secondary resources of metallic, construction and industrial minerals and substitution of Critical Raw Materials, addressing one or several areas of the circular economy. The main topics were: \n1.    Supply of raw materials from exploration and mining ; 2. Design; 3. Processing, Production and Remanufacturing; 4. Recycling of End-of-Life Products; 5. Cross-cutting topics: (5.1 New business models; 5.2. Improvement of methods or data for environmental impact assessment; 5.3    Social acceptance and trust/public perception of raw materials) \n35 full proposals were submitted by 28th September and the eligible proposals were scientifically assessed by an international independent Evaluation Panel. Considering the ranking list of full-proposals established by the Panel and the available public funds (national, regional and EC contribution), 16 transnational R&I projects were supported that involved 38.6% of enterprises, out of a total of 88 beneficiaries. The total allocated funding was 12.3 M\u20ac (including EC contribution) from 16M\u20ac of total project costs. All five topics are covered by the funded projects. The project coordinators received feedback on 15th January 2018. The data and publishable summaries of the 16 funded projects and the call statistics were made public at the ERA-MIN 2 website. An independent observer that followed the whole evaluation process concluded that the process was fair, transparent and in compliance with the EU co-funding rules. \nDuring the Raw Materials Week 2017, the future ERA-MIN Joint Call 2018 was promoted at the Infoday on Societal Challenge 5 and leaflets of the first call were distributed. At the match-making events on 7th and on 9th November, there was the opportunity to make awareness of ERA-MIN 2 activities to representatives of EU and non-EU countries with which ERA-MIN 2 would like to cooperate in the future.  \nERA-MIN 2 has built a strong global network with the European raw materials players as well as with non-European stakeholders. An Advisory Board (AB) was established to ensure that the call topics were relevant for the EU and the industry.
