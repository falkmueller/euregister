The organisational profile of APDES comprehends four lines of intervention that guide the developed projects: health, harm reduction and human rights; health education; social cohesion and employment; cooperation and development. \n \nAll the tasks carried out follow successfully delineated work principles, such as research, participative methodologies, outreach intervention, advocacy, assessment and interdisciplinary approach. \n \nHeadquartered in Vila Nova de Gaia, APDES develops several activities in this municipality and cities like Porto, Barcelos, Guarda, Viseu, Set\u00fabal and Lisbon. Since 2008, APDES has internationalised its scope of action and organised several initiatives in European countries, Cape Verde and Angola \u2013 a territory where the process of institutional formalisation of the Agency is currently being carried out, alongside intervention and training projects. \n \nThe affiliation of APDES with other organisations is quite extensive; APDES is the founding and constituent member of several national and international networks in the ambit of harm reduction associated with psychoactive drugs use, sex work, access to employment and human rights.\u2028 \n \nIn 2011, after being recognised as a Non-governmental Development Organisation (NGDO) by the Cam\u00f5es I.P., APDES started to benefit from the status of public utility. \n \nOur goal is to decrease the risks associated with drug use and sexual activity; the possible negative consequences of these behaviours (at an individual or communitarian level) can be reduced through adequate interventions. Additionally, we focus on the research of more effective ways to protect our beneficiaries \u2013 sex workers, people who use drugs and others who are in a vulnerable social situation \u2013 as well as the communities they live in. Our main concern is to promote health and defend the human rights of those we work with, through projects designed with their active involvement - in order to guarantee the well-being and health of the participants.", "industry_forums": "", "inter_groups": "", "number_of_persons_involved": "12", "relevant_communication": "INWORK     \nLifelong Learning Programme    Education and training \n \nDPIP BAONPS    Justice Programme of the European Union    DG Justice \n \nHEP C and Drug Use    Drug Prevention and Information Programme    DG Justice \n \nEuropeAid SIKOLA    EuropeAid - Co-operation office    International Cooperation and Development \n \nEuropeAid DH    EuropeAid - Co-operation office    International Cooperation and Development \n \nINDOORS     Daphne    DG Justice \n \nAllcool - Chafea Health Programe \n \nHands UP - Against Children\u00b4s Corporal Punishment - Rights, Equality and Citizenship Programe (DG Justice) \n \nSocial and Solidarity Economy in Europeu - Erasmus + Programe \n \nCivil Society Involvement in Drug Policy - DG Justice \n \nTransR - Trans Sex Workers Rights are Human Rights - REC Action Grant - EU (DG Justice and Consumers)", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2016", "lat": 41.062036, "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "400000-499999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "1400846", "legal_status": "ONGD", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Jos\u00e9 Barbosa", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "Director", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+351)227531106"}
