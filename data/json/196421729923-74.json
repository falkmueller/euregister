The stark fact is that butterflies and moths continue to decline at an alarming rate, despite Butterfly Conservation\u2019s best efforts over the last 40 years. Our data shows they are declining faster than most other well-documented groups of plants and animals, so our task is both daunting and complex.  For many species, we know what needs to be done to halt decline and support recoveries. In order to tackle these losses and achieve the aims of the charity, we have to dramatically increase our capacity and influence over the next few years. Our work will benefit other wildlife and the ecosystems upon which all life depends. \nOur mission is to halt, and reverse, the decline in butterflies and moths, thereby helping to create a healthier environment in which we can all live, and build a strong and effective organisation capable of delivering our vision. \nButterfly Conservation\u2019s new top-level 2025 strategy was agreed by Council members in 2016. The strategy takes account of progress and achievements of the previous 2020 Vision and provides an update of the future direction and approach we wish to take at the same time maintaining continuity of our current work. \nAt the top level of the strategy, the core aims of Butterfly Conservation are to: \n\u2022    Recover threatened butterflies and moths \n\u2022    Increase numbers of widespread species \n\u2022    Inspire people to understand and deliver species conservation \n\u2022    Promote international conservation actions.", "industry_forums": "", "inter_groups": "", "number_of_persons_involved": "11", "relevant_communication": "Environment, Agriculture, pollinator strategy, status of Lepidoptera reports, conservation manuals, scientific publications.", "financial_year_end_date": "01/03/2017", "lat": 50.6481646, "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "3692000", "legal_status": "Charity and Company Limited by Guarantee", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Julie Williams", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "Company Secretary", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+44)1929400209"}
