Intuitive Surgical develops, manufactures and markets the da Vinci\u00ae Surgical System.  \n  \nOur mission is to make surgery easier and more effective for surgeons, patients and their families. Intuitive Surgical is committed to delivering significantly superior and measurable \u201cPatient Value\u201d by improving surgical outcomes and reducing surgical trauma. We do this by providing surgeons with superior surgical vision, dexterity, and precision through unparalleled state of the art robotic, vision, and instrument technology. We strive to exceed our customer\u2019s expectations every day.  \n  \nThe Company's da Vinci\u00ae Surgical System enables surgeons to operate minimally invasively through a few small incisions or the belly button from a nearby ergonomic console. da Vinci Systems are not programmed to perform surgery on their own. Instead, the procedure is performed entirely by a surgeon who controls the system. da Vinci Systems offer surgeons high-definition 3D vision, a magnified view, and robotic and computer assistance. They use specialized instrumentation, including a miniaturized surgical camera and wristed instruments (i.e., scissors, scalpels and forceps) that are designed to help with precise dissection and reconstruction deep inside the body.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+1)408-523-2100"}
