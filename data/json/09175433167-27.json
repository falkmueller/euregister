In addition, AquaFed has been a member of the EUWI steering group. \n- To ensure that the various ways of involving the private sector in delivering water and sanitation services to users are properly understood and evaluated so that national and local governments can choose the public or private management option that suits their individual needs best on a case-by-case basis. \n \nIt is important to note that AquaFed is not a commercial organisation. It does not claim that private management of water services is better than public management and publicly acknowledges the existence of well-run water systems in both cases.  \n \nAquaFed\u2019s objective is to find solutions to solving water issues with all contributing stakeholders including governments, institutions, labour and customer representatives, NGOs, public & private water professionals.", "belgium_office_city": "Brussels", "head_office_phone": "(+0033)153890810"}
