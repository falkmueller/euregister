We work by convening and networking, generating and sharing information and knowledge, strengthening skills, and promoting collective advocacy actions. \n \nOur Strategic objective is to support and strengthen the efforts of the broad European SRHR community to advance SRHR in a global perspective.  \n \nTo achieve our strategic objective, we focus our work around four core areas: \n \n1.
