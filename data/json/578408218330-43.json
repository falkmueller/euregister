It has a forward-looking approach and operates as a think-tank, identifying issues as they emerge. \nThe OSE is a partner organisation in several European Framework Programmes and is actively involved in some major networks of academic excellence in Europe and North America. \n \nThe OSE works closely with the Belgian and European public authorities, as well as with trade unions (including in the context of TURI, a network of research institutes close to the trade unions) and civil society organisations. As a result, it has acquired specialist, in-depth knowledge on the social dimension of European integration and a profound understanding of the European context.  \n \nFollowing a decision of the federal government in July 2014, the Belgian Federal Science Policy Office has recognised the OSE as \u2018Scientific Institution\u2019, thereby acknowledging the quality of its independent research. \n \nThe OSE\u2019s main goals are to produce independent and state-of-the-art critical analysis of the social dimension of European integration. This implies, more concretely, that we: \n\u00b7 Analyse the impact of European integration on social and employment policies both at EU level and within the Member States. \n\u00b7 Conduct research, formulate policy proposals and produce training toolkits. \n\u00b7 Provide an ongoing platform for discussion for a wide range of stakeholders, esp. trade union organisations. \n\u00b7 Widely disseminate the results of our reflections through our website, Newsletters, publications (incl. the OSE Working Papers Series), social media (Twitter and LinkedIn) and events. \n \nThe OSE consists of a multidisciplinary and multilingual team of researchers and analysts \u2013 bolstered by research associates and by interns from all over Europe and North America. \n \nThe OSE team: \n\u00b7 Has a variety of expertise in cross-cutting areas such as economic and monetary union and its impact on the social dimension of European integration, institutional \nissues and the EU\u2019s social policy-making mechanisms (including policy coordination, EU legislation, social dialogue and EU funding). \n\u00b7 Is able to draw upon a broad-based network of public authorities, (academic and other) researchers, think-tanks, European and national trade unionists, social \npartner representatives and other social stakeholders. \n\u00b7 Has more than 20 years of expertise in organizing both major (amongst other things, within the framework of the Belgian Presidencies of the EU in 2001 and 2010) and smaller events (incl. the OSE Lunchtime sessions). \n\u00b7 Can draw on in-house resources, which include our website; our three-monthly Newsletter; our Health Care Newsletter (in English, French and Dutch); our Working Paper series (Research, Briefing and Opinion papers); our Lunchtime Sessions; our LinkedIn page and Twitter account.", "industry_forums": "", "head_office_phone": "(+32)25371971", "level_of_interest": "European, national", "relevant_communication": "- Annual Conference on 'Social Developments in the European Union' at the European Econolic and Social Committee; \n- Regular OSE Lunchtimes Sessions on issues topping the EU agenda;  \n- Organisation of major (amongst other things, within the framework of the Belgian Presidencies of the EU in 2001 and 2010) and smaller events; \n \n- Annual production of a range of articles, book chapters and Working Papers, as well as edited volumes, digests, book reviews and opinions. \n- The OSE Working Paper series, encompassing three different publications: \u2018Research\u2019, \u2018Briefing\u2019 and \u2018Opinion\u2019 papers;  \n- The Health Care Newsletter (EN, FR and NL), providing regular summaries of current EU developments that might affect national health care systems.", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2017", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "800000-899999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "942677", "legal_status": "ASBL", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Bart Vanhercke", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "Director"}
