Our actions help the most vulnerable in our society as well the environment by reducing organic food waste. \nWe started by saving 12 cheese pies from a bakery in 2011 and today we save & offer the equivalent of more than 20.000 portions of food on a daily basis. Since the beginning of our action we have saved & offered more than 16 million portions of food to hundreds of welfare organizations and charities all over Greece. \nWe approach the issue of food waste holistically through the following programs: \n\u2022    \u201cStop Food Waste\u201d: increasing awareness about food waste \n\u2022    \u201cBoroume at School\u201d: educational program \n\u2022    \u201cBoroume Gleaning\u201d: reducing food waste on the field \n\u2022    \u201cBoroume at the Farmers\u2019 Market\u201d: reducing food waste at farmer\u2019s markets \n\u2022    \u201cBoroume in the Neighborhood\u201d: informing potential food donors in a neighborhood about our food saving mechanism \nThrough our \u201cWe Are Family\u201d program we provide nutritional support in an immediate, transparent und dignified way to families in great need. \nOur vision is to develop a social movement to reduce food waste and at the same time increase nutritional support to people in need based on volunteer support.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+30)210327805"}
