Founded in 2009, the aim of WFAD is to work for a drug-free world. The work of WFAD is built on the principles of universal fellowship and basic human and democratic rights. We believe that working for a drug-free world will promote peace, human development, democracy, tolerance, equality, freedom and justice. \n \nThe World Federation Against Drugs (WFAD) is dedicated to identifying and promoting effective and affordable laws, policies and programs consistent with modern culture and values that limit illegal drug use and illegal drug trafficking. These initiatives build on a century of international efforts to limit the use of illegal drugs, incorporated into three major treaties accepted by virtually every country in the world and managed by the United Nations. The treaties require coordinated international efforts that reject the use of drugs outside of tightly controlled medical practice.  \n \nAt the heart of the WFAD approach is the commitment to a balance of efforts in law enforcement and efforts in prevention and treatment. These efforts are inspired and improved by a dedication to research into the nature and consequences of illegal drug use and into the efforts to reduce illegal drug use. WFAD works to find better ways to link the systems of criminal justice and treatment and prevention system to reduce illegal drug use more than either can achieve alone.    \n \nWFAD consists of over 200 member organizations, active all over the world.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+46)86442174"}
