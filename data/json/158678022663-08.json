EUWMA members are public institutions with legal powers. EUWMA was established in 1996 with the primary aim to increase cooperation between European Water Management Associations, so as to provide relevant information, position papers and policy documents to national governments, the European Commission, the European Parliament and other relevant institutions. In addition, EUWMA promotes the exchange of knowledge and best practices between members. \n \nIn our view, EU water legislation can only be successful if water is managed at regional level. As water challenges vary in different river basins, solutions should be tailored to local conditions, rather than the \u2018one-size-fits-all\u2019 approach often favoured by national government departments. \n \nGood and efficient water management is what we stand for, at regional and national level as well as in Europe. \n \nObjective: \nEUWMA aims to increase cooperation between its members, so as to provide information, views, position papers and policy documents to governments, the European Commission, the European Parliament and other institutions. \n \nActivities: \n\u2022Holding meetings to exchange views and formulate policies on matters of common interest. \n\u2022Jointly considering proposals by the European Union and submitting joint proposals. \n\u2022Exchanging proposals to national governments on European issues. \n\u2022Keeping members updated on developments that could impact on flood protection and land drainage. \n\u2022Exchanging administrative and technical information and publications of common interest. \n\u2022Seeking collaboration in research and development. \n\u2022Organising a yearly general meeting and workshops on relevant themes.", "industry_forums": "", "head_office_phone": "(+31)703519810", "level_of_interest": "European", "relevant_communication": "", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2017", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "0-9999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "6800", "legal_status": "vereniging", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Dirk Staat", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "Secretariat EUWMA"}
