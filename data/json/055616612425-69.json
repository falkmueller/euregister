We want to prevent even more plastics entering the sea in the future. So: \n \nBe aware:  \nThe Plastic Soup Foundation constantly draws attention to plastic soup through campaigns, news articles and social media. \n \nGet educated:  \nAnyone who wants to find out more about plastic soup is in the right place when they come to us. For instance in 2016 Plastic Soup Foundation developed educational programs for primary schools and secondary schools. In addition we work together with experts, politicians, organizations, universities and companies which have similar missions or visions. \n \nFind solutions: \nThe Plastic Soup Foundation stimulates all possible (innovative) solutions which help tackle the causes of plastic soup at source. Measures which prevent plastic entering the environment, water and eventually ending up in the sea have the greatest impact in our opinion. This includes reducing the amount of single-use consumer plastics, the development of a Plastic Footprint for companies as well as smart devices which collect plastic in waterways.", "industry_forums": "", "head_office_phone": "(+31)854016244", "level_of_interest": "global", "relevant_communication": "EU Life+ project Mermiads www.life-mermaids.eu  \noceancleanwash.org \nBeatthemicrobead.org \nplasticsoupfoundation.org", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2016", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "743223", "legal_status": "Stichting", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Jeroen Dagevos", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "Head of Programs"}
