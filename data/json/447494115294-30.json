Its member companies are the European economic interest grouping ARTE E.E.I.G, ARTE France and ARTE Deutschland TV GmbH. Its mission, as described in Article 2 of the E.E.I.G\u2019s formation agreement, is \u201cto conceive and produce television programmes which (\u2026) are cultural and international in character and conducive to promoting understanding and cooperation between Europe\u2019s nations and to broadcast these programmes or to authorize their broadcast\u201d. \nThis joint television channel should bring French and German citizens closer on a cultural level and promote cultural integration throughout Europe. Creating a television channel for two audiences was a first in television\u2019s history and is still an exception in the global TV market to this date. The channel is broadcast in two language versions at the same time, in France and in Germany. \nThree quarters of ARTE\u2019s programmes consist of broadcasts provided in equal proportions by ARTE France and ARTE Deutschland. The other quarter is provided by ARTE E.E.I.G and European partners: the channel has forged many co-production partnerships with European public broadcasters. \nSince its creation, ARTE has been committed to cultural diversity and multilingualism, convinced that better circulation of European audiovisual content can make a considerable contribution to European cultural integration.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+33)0388142222"}
