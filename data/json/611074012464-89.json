Patients with these devastating diseases often have no effective treatment options, and they and their families suffer with little hope.  \n \nOur first commercial product is Soliris\u00ae (eculizumab), the world's first and only approved terminal complement inhibitor. Today, Soliris is approved in nearly 50 countries as a treatment for patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), and in the United States, European Union, Japan and other countries as a treatment for patients with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS). Both PNH and aHUS are life-threatening, ultra-rare diseases.  \nIn August 2017 the European Commission (EC) approved the extension of the indication for Soliris\u00ae (eculizumab) to include the treatment of refractory generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) in adults who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody-positive, an ultra-rare subset of patients who continues to suffer from severe disease symptoms and complications despite therapies currently used for MG, a debilitating, chronic and progressive autoimmune neuromuscular disease. \n \nAlexion's metabolic franchise includes two highly innovative enzyme replacement therapies for patients with life-threatening and ultra-rare disorders: Strensiq\u00ae (asfotase alfa) is approved for patients with hypophosphatasia (HPP) and Kanuma\u00ae (sebelipase alfa) is approved for patients with lysosomal acid lipase deficiency (LAL-D).", "industry_forums": "", "head_office_phone": "(+1)4752302596", "level_of_interest": "global", "relevant_communication": "- European Commission consultation on SPC  \n- European Commission Regulation on health technology assessment and amending Directive 2011/24/EU \n- European Commission study on the evaluation of the EU orphan legislation", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2017", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "200000-299999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "0", "legal_status": "Public company", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Thibault  De Lary de Latour", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "Executive Director Global Value, Access and Policy"}
