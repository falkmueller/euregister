Home to a third of the EU\u2019s population, the development of these areas is essential for their competitiveness. Cross-border territories are key areas within the EU, where both the effects of movement towards European integration as well as the remaining obstacles to integration can best be studied, whether this relates to the mobility of people, services, goods or capital. This is why border regions are often described as the laboratories for European integration. However, obstacles to cooperation remain because of the lack of knowledge of the \u2018other\u2019 (culture, language, judicial-social-political system) and lack of appropriate methodologies for intercultural work. This creates a need for specialised training, counselling and support to be adapted to the specific characteristics of each frontier. \n \n  \n \nWHO WE ARE \n \nThe Transfrontier Euro-Institut Network (TEIN), formed in 2010, now brings together 14 partners from 8 border regions in Europe. Its unique feature is that it consists of universities, research institutes and training centres which are dedicated to the practical business of cross-border cooperation in Europe. \n \nTEIN is led by the Euro-Institut, created in 1993 in Kehl/Strasbourg on the French/German/Swiss border with the aim of facilitating cross-border cooperation. All members have subscribed to a common charter to ensure the organization of the network and the quality of its output. TEIN partners come from maritime borders, old European borders, new eastern borders and post-conflict borders. Because of this, TEIN is able to measure the need for capacity building in cross-border cooperation throughout Europe. \n \nTEIN Members are real actors of the cross-border cooperation. Their work involves cross-border training and facilitation, managing cross-border projects, providing mentoring, training and advice for cross-border actors, and researching on cross-border issues. In this respect, TEIN can be seen as representing a genuinely bottom-up approach. \n \nTEIN has been funded by the EU Leonardo da Vinci Programme (Leonardo Partnership 2010-2012 and Leonardo Transfer of Innovation 2012-2014). \n \n  \n \nWHAT WE DO \n \nTEIN\u2019s objective is to build capacity in cross-border contexts to strengthen European integration. To that end, TEIN Members follow the aim of facilitating cross-border cooperation and providing practical solutions to European transfrontier issues. \n \nTEIN\u2019s vision is one where know-how, training and best practices are exchanged freely and generously across European borders. \n \nIn that respect, TEIN Partners: \n \n- Develop training and research that is \u2018fit for purpose\u2019 for cross-border issues and in  cross-border contexts; \n- Capitalize on learning from the different regional initiatives; \n- Work on new products such as \n*transferable training modules (e.g. training for cross-border project managers); \n*methods (e.g. needs-analysis methods in cross-border regions); \n*tools (e.g. impact assessment toolkit for cross-border cooperation); \n*Produce relevant research to be disseminated to actors involved in transfrontier cooperation at different levels; \n*Increase knowledge and awareness of cross-border issues (at local, regional, national and European level) by producing high quality work in this field.", "industry_forums": "", "inter_groups": "", "number_of_persons_involved": "5", "relevant_communication": "MAIN EVENTS: \n- 10.07.2012 Bruxelles: \u201cThe Future of European Territorial Cooperation: Capacity Building in Cross-Border Territories\u201d \n- 21.09.2013 Strasbourg: \"Capacity building and Cross-Border Cooperation: An Approach for the Future!\" \n- 18.09.2014 Strasbourg:\"Tools for capacity building for actors of cross-border cooperation\" \n- 08.10.2014 Bruxelles: OpenDays Workshop \"TEIN: The answer to the need for capacity building for an efficient cross-border cooperation\" \n- Several Training activities and local events in the different \"TEIN border regions\" \n- 10.10.2017 EWRC-Workshop: Enhancing capacities of regions and cities for better cross-border cooperation \n \nPROJECT \n-The  Professionalizing  Actors  of  Transfrontier  Cooperation  \u2013  Transfrontier  Euro-Institut  \nNetwork (PAT-TEIN) project was launched by 8 TEIN partners from 5 border regions  \nin 2012.
