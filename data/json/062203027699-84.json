The company is rooted in a decade-long pioneer experience of using media for civil society empowerment, good governance and democratization.  \n \nEU policies on good governance, peace, democracy, human rights, gender mainstreaming, and regional integration provide the framework for our portfolio that primarily focuses on media and communication in transitional contexts, development communication, particularly the role of media in countering conflicts and violent extremism, accountability, democratic governance and pluralism. Our comprehensive experience includes programme and project development, management, monitoring and evaluation of comprehensive national and regional programmes in EU partner countries. We have collaborated with DG NEAR, DEVCO, EEAS, DG REV, RELEX, and EuroStat on programmes and projects concerning civil society empowerment, governance, human rights, transparency, corruption and sensitive issues related to census operations. We have designed, implemented, managed, and evaluated a significant number of projects aiming to strengthen the media watchdog role in civil society for decades, most recently a regional support programme and Terms of Reference for technical assistance to public service broadcasters in the Western Balkans and Turkey for the EU based on a regional needs assessment and the Guidelines for EU support to media freedom and media integrity in the enlargement countries 2014-20..  \n \nOur technical assistance to civil society, local authorities, and EU Delegations include strategic communication projects, evaluations of media freedom, and the development of media strategies and media policies aiming to enhance reconciliation and conflict prevention and strengthen democratic and participatory policy making processes in line with the European Union values and pluralism in public institutions. Our most recent project of this kind is a multi-UN agency security sector reform programme in Madagascar aiming to empower and make the voice of vulnerable population groups (women, children, teenagers) heard in security issues, improve dialogue, question stereotypes and prejudices, minimise fear and build peace. Our key approach to these assignment is to routinely involve civil society groups and political leaders in comprehensive participatory processes to enhance public ownership and lasting impact.  \n \nWe have an impressive track record in complex studies, assessments and strategic reviews of institutional programming and programmatic support to crisis prevention, recovery, and peacebuilding for development agencies such as UNDP, Dfid, Danida and Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland.", "belgium_office_city": "Bruxelles", "head_office_phone": "(+45)30454500"}
