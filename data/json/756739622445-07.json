In addition, we are also the independent, official youth wing of the European Green Party (EGP). \n \nThe basis of the activities of FYEG is our political work on a European level, in a European political space. This is not limited to lobbying inside the European Parliament. FYEG is also involved on a street level, running campaigns together with its Member Organisations. At the same time it is not afraid of lifting topics and relevant questions from the local organisations, supporting them and spreading them throughout the network.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+32)2 26 60 72 7"}
