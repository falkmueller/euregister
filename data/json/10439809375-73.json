From undercover investigations, to high level lobby meetings, we aim to engage on every level where we might make a difference and bring about change. \n \nOur work has revealed how, rather than benefiting a country\u2019s citizens, abundant timber, diamonds, minerals, oil and other natural resources can incentivise corruption, destabilise governments, and lead to war. Through our investigations, advocacy and campaigning, we seek solutions to the \u2018resource curse\u2019 so that citizens of resource-rich countries can get a fair share of their country\u2019s wealth. \n \nOur works falls into three broad strands: \n \nCorruption \nCorruption blights millions of lives by diverting vast sums of money earned from a country\u2019s natural resources away from its rightful owners \u2013 the citizens of that country. Global Witness campaigns to prevent companies, governments and the international financial system from facilitating corruption on a grand scale. \n \nResources & conflict \nGlobal Witness campaigns to break the links between natural resources, armed conflict, and human rights abuses.  Our work now covers a range of countries that are affected by or are emerging from violent instability. \n \nEnvironmental governance \nForests and land are the planet\u2019s finite resources.  Yet 80% of the world\u2019s tropical forests have been depleted or entirely destroyed and a quarter of the planet\u2019s land has been degraded by deforestation, over-exploitation, industrial activities, and over-grazing.  As demand for resources increases and the planet\u2019s population continues to grow, it is vital that that we take better care of what we have got.", "belgium_office_city": "Brussels", "head_office_phone": "(+44)2074925820"}
