Our vision is to contribute to a strong civil society in which women\u2019s voices are heard, and where gender equality and women's empowerment contributes to stable societies. Our working model is based on a long-term approach in the regions where we work.  \n\u2022 In the Balkans, Kvinna till Kvinna has supported partner organisations since 1993 with focus on women's participation, rule of law etc. In recent years, Kvinna till Kvinna has worked extensivly together with partner organisations to provide input to the EU Progress Reports for the Balkans. Focus has been to mainstream gender and women's rights throughout the documents. \n\u2022 Kvinna till Kvinna is involved in the EU financed EPNK (The European Partnership for the Peaceful Settlement of the Conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh) programme together with other international peace building organisations. The focus is to build capacity among the conflict affected populations in Southern Caucasus.   \n\u2022 During 2011-12, Kvinna till Kvinna carried out the Women and Conflict Resolution Project, finansied by the EU. It consisted of trainings and networking between women's organisations in different conflict affected regions; a report, Equal Power \u2013 Lasting Peace, based on research in five conflict affected regions to learn more about the obstacles to women\u2019s participation. The report has been presented in the UN, the EU, and in Sweden (http://kvinnatillkvinna.se/wp-content/uploads/qbank/df0aab058ce179e4f7ab135ed4e641a9.pdf) and a documentary \"Six Days\" following three women human rights defenders. \n\u2022  Kvinna till Kvinna acknowledges the importance of Women Human Rights Defenders and the threats and violence they encounter.
