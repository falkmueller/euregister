Thus, cooperation and national and international exchanges have been a constant focus on the guidelines of the R&D strategy of the UA, mainly through the participation in numerous programs of Education, Science and Technology of the European Commission (EC) and also other International programs. UAVR has been participating in various EU education and research programmes/projects and running several joint doctoral programmes. For instance,  During 2017, 351 research and technology transfer projects were active in UAVR. From these 15 were ERANET or JPI Actions, of which 2 coordinated by UAVR, and 96 were funded by International and European Programmes, of which 34 by ERASMUS+, 12 by FP7, 32 by Horizon 2020, 10 of them coordinated by UAVR. Among these projects are two ERC Grants, one TWINNING and one TEAMING projects. By its strategic importance, TEAMING project is of particular relevance, as it enable the UAVR's participation in the creation/development of national scientific infrastructure in the key area of health. Also, UAVR as an extensive experience with Interreg Programmes, LLL, RFSR, LIFE+, ERASMUS MUNDUS, among others.
