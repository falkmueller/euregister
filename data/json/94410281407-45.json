Our key goals are to encourage competition, transparency, data privacy, security and respect for intellectual property protection. Furthermore, ICOMP brings together participants from across the Internet to identify and promote best practices aimed at stimulating creativity and innovation and foster an online environment founded on security, respect and trust. ICOMP\u2019s members collectively support principles which they believe promote: \n \n- Healthy competition in online advertising to fund online innovation and content. \n \n-     Consumer understanding of the ways in which information about them is used and how consumer privacy will be respected to help Internet and e-commerce reach their full potential. \n \n-     Intellectual property rights to foster creativity and innovation by enabling firms and individuals to capture the commercial value of their efforts. \n \nICOMP\u2019s work is guided by the following principles: \n \n1.    Competition: Advertisers, web publishers and consumers all rely on healthy competition in online advertising to generate online innovation and content. Online advertising will continue to serve as the engine that drives the online economy, but only if vibrant competition in this critical sector is preserved. \n \n2.    Transparency: Companies benefiting from a very strong market position can sometimes achieve the status of \u201cgate-keepers to the Internet\u201d. There is a special obligation on such companies to be completely transparent about their business practices. \n \n3.    Privacy: The Internet and e-commerce will reach their full potential only if consumers are informed of the ways in which their information is used and are confident that their privacy will be respected. \n \n4.    Security: Today\u2019s online consumer is subject to a variety of information security threats, including hacking, data spills, malware and identify theft. Companies that collect and store personal data must take all reasonable measures to ensure it remains safe and confidential. \n \n5.
