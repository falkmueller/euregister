In this sense, we are interested in how the kings and chiefs of Africa, Oceania and the Americas can work with the EU and the EU\u2019s policies on development and cooperation, including the aim above all to eradicate poverty through a sustainable approach.  Accordingly, the document \u2018A Decent Life for All: From Vision to Collective Action\u2019 is particularly relevant to our approach. \n \nWe are interested in seeing how traditional African, Oceanian leaders and those of the Americas, such as kings and chiefs, can work with the EU to try to become in control of their own futures and development, particularly in relation to the following issues: \n\u2022    addressing the causes of vulnerability, e.g. poor access to food, clean water, education, health, employment, land, social services, infrastructure and a healthy environment \n\u2022    reducing developing countries' debt burden, so they have more money for vital public investments, instead of paying interest to rich lenders in industrialised countries \n\u2022    promoting self-help and poverty-eradication strategies \n\u2022    supporting the democratic process \n\u2022    improving respect for human rights, including equality between the sexes \n\u2022    encouraging a more stable economic environment in which businesses can grow and create jobs. \n \nWe will also participate in relevant consultations, such as the current consultation on the rules on the import of cultural goods.  This could be an issue important to a traditional community as a potential source of revenue, but also as a safeguard against the looting or disposal of important cultural heritage.", "level_of_interest": "global, national, regional/local", "organisation_name": "Centre for the Study of the Kingdoms and Chiefdoms of Africa, Oceania and the Americas Ltd (CSKCA)", "belgium_office_post_code": "", "procurement": "", "section": "IV - Think tanks, research and academic institutions", "lon": -2.8998372, "source": "", "belgium_office_address": "", "belgium_office_phone": "", "number_of_ep_accredited_persons": "", "overall_budget_turnover_as_a_range": "", "subsection": "Think tanks and research institutions", "no_geo_reference": true, "persons_accredited_for_access_to_european_parliament_premises": "", "estimate_of_costs_absolute_amount": "0", "registration_date": "30/10/2016", "website_address": "https://www.facebook.com/kingdomschiefdoms/", "commission_expert_groups_and_other_similar_entities_european_commission": "NA", "head_office_post_box": "", "head_office_city": "Dundee", "membership": "Civil Society Partner status with the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs - no. 658698", "head_office_post_code": "DD5 3UY", "goals__remit": "Our role is to study and research into the kingdoms and chiefdoms of Africa, Oceania and the Americas to develop global partnerships for development, through increasing understanding about the role traditional leaders can play in these spheres.", "industry_forums": "", "inter_groups": "", "number_of_persons_involved": "1", "relevant_communication": "One of our particular aims is to produce an annual journal, \"Kingship\", which we hope will serve as a source of evidence for the EU in considering the role that traditional leaders, such as kings and chiefs, can play in development and cooperation.
