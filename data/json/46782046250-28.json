That is why OMCT places their protection at the heart of its mission, through alerts, activities of prevention, advocacy and awareness-raising as well as direct support. \n \nAccompanying and strengthening organisations in the field: \n \nOMCT provides its members with the tools and services that enable them to carry out their work and strengthen their capacity and effectiveness in the fight against torture. \nOMCT presence in Tunisia is part of its commitment to supporting civil society in the process of transition to the rule of law and respect for the absolute prohibition of torture.", "belgium_office_city": "Bruxelles", "head_office_phone": "(+41)22 809 49 39"}
