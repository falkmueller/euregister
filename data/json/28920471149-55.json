We say no farmer\u2019s disappearance.   \n-    The rights of women farmers should be recognised. \n-    Access to land, water, seeds, and credit should become a right: that includes farmers\u2019 rights to save their seeds and to improve plant varieties.  \n-    the setting up of young farmers has to be promoted. \n-    Farmers\u2019 income should come first from selling their products.  For farm prices reflecting the real value of  the products, the two following conditions are necessarfy: \no    Supply management instruments should be implemented, to avoid surpluses or shortages. \no    Any dumping at export (at prices below the production costs) must be forbidden, and in exchange for this duty, the EU and other countries have the right to protect themselves from imports at too low prices. \n-    To maintain a countryside alive in all regions, \no    Sustainable family farming should be maintained and developed: European funds are necessary, especially for small farms and less favoured areas. \no    The process of concentration of the agricultural production has to be stopped and the production better distributed between the regions and between the farms. \no    Public services should be maintained and improved in all regions \n-    The modes of production which harm the environment, use too much energy, damage the quality and the safety of the products have to be re-orientated. \n-    Agricultural land should be used first for food production. \n-    Biodiversity should be safeguarded: GMOs and patents of life must be banned. \n-    Rural development policy does not have to replace the CAP, to correct the failures of the CAP, but has to complete the CAP by developing employment first. \n-    Short food miles should have priority compared to long transport and international markets. \n-    migrant agricultural workers have to be treated without discrimination, with the  same rights as the Europeans; \n-    We need international trade rules without dumping, based on food sovereignty, human rights, and international labour rights.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+32)22173112"}
