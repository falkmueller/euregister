We work to promote and defend the rights of citizens to high social, labour, environmental, consumer and public health standards. \nThe member organisations seek to improve social, environmental, labour, consumer, economic and public health standards for citizens and to continue building an inclusive and competitive Europe founded on economic, social and environmental sustainability. \nIt is a shared concern that European legislation is increasingly presented by the European institutions and some member states as a burden when the vast majority of regulatory measures are essential for guaranteeing the rights of citizens, workers and the environment as well as the EU\u2019s four freedoms. \nMore concretely, there is common apprehension that the European Commission\u2019s \u201cBetter Regulation\u201d agenda does not further public interest, but rather aims to weaken or neglect essential regulations protecting workers, consumers, citizens and the environment. The focus of EU decision making should be on improving regulation, not deregulation. \nThe Watchdog Network follows the EU\u2019s Better Regulation Agenda closely and provides input into the processes and debates, raises awareness among stakeholders and society, and challenges the widely-held belief that regulation is a burden for society. \nThe network shares information and expertise, but can also advocate its positions to decision makers, inform our networks about the consequences of the so-called Better Regulation agenda and participate in media outreach. \nThe work of the network is coordinated by a steering group comprised of the following organisations: \nBEUC, the European Consumer organisation \nEuropean Public Health Alliance \nEuropean Environmental Bureau \nFinance Watch \nFriends of the Earth Europe \nUNI Europa \n\u00d6sterreichischer Gewerkschaftsbund \nA full list of member organisations is available here: http://betterregwatch.eu/BRWN_members.pdf", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+32)2 234 56 54"}
