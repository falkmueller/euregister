The GoGolf Europe project has successfully secured co-funding from the European Commission under Erasmus+, the EU programme for Education, Training, Youth and Sport for 2014-2020.  The project will unite five European countries \u2013 the Czech Republic, Estonia, France, the Netherlands and Portugal \u2013 in a three year initiative designed to test innovative new access pathways to golf for European youth while also documenting the unique health benefits which the sport can provide to all people. In conjunction with the EGA, the project will unite the National Golf Governing Bodies of the five participating countries alongside the PGAs of Europe, the European Observatoire of Sport and Employment, and the University of St Andrews as the official research partner.   \n \nAlongside the GoGolf Europe project, researchers from the University of St Andrews are collaborating very closely with scientists at the University of Edinburgh on several projects concerning the growing global research agenda around the health and wellbeing benefits of golf participation.   \n \n2. The European Golf Industry has entered a complex phase as the EU works to repair the financial system and business landscape. Recessions are a time to consider collaborating with other organizations to lower operational costs and to focus finite funds on the necessary infrastructure to support essential activities. \nThis holds true in countries like in the Mediterranean Europe, here the golf product is more focused on the golf tourism market than on local players, leaving the governments and national governing bodies, i.e. the Golf Federations, with very few opportunities to develop golf at a local level. \n \nIn order to move forward with the ongoing needs and opportunities the French Golf Federation, Italian Golf Federation, the Portuguese Golf Federation and the Royal Spanish Golf Federation have agreed to establish a joint working group to act as a task force, sharing knowledge, information and ideas that might lead to practical solutions at regional and national level. \n \nThe Southern Europe Region Working Group (SER WG) aims to assess the need for research and guidance for golf development related activities and to prepare the basis for such research or guidance as tool to stimulating innovation within the Golf industry. \nThroughout its lifecycle, the SER WG will focus on the spreading of excellence, the dissemination of knowledge and the capture of opportunities for exploiting its results. \n \nThe SER WG will work on very specific tasks. Individuals participating in these groups are expected to have the time, interest, and commitment to participate in the production of deliverables assigned to the group. It is expected that technical Working Group members have the necessary skills and talents to achieve group goals. \n \nMembers of the SER WG provide valuable input and technical assistance in areas of strategic importance to the SE federations and stakeholders. Members are expected to actively participate in group meetings and events, volunteer, collaborate, and complete specific group goals. \n \nWorking Group Members \u2013 Current Members \n\u2022    French Golf Federation \n\u2022    Italian Golf Federation \n\u2022    Portuguese Golf Federation \n\u2022    Royal Spanish Golf Federation", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2016", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "1000000-1249999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "1888647", "legal_status": "sport federation NPO", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Alexandra Bet\u00e2mio de Almeida", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "Planning and Sustainability Coord."}
