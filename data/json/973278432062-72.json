The membership organizations are primarily professional associations in the health field and the associations of county councils and local authorities. Sponsored by mainly public health authorities, the Committee develops and produces health promotion material on many themes and to many target groups.  \n \nThemes include pregnancy prevention, child and maternity health, sexually transmitted diseases, breastfeeding, child raising, alcohol problems, tobacco cessation, prevention of infectious diseases. \n \nDuring the last 10 years DCHE has also gained specific expertice in developing, implementing and evaluating patient education, where the trainers consist of health professionals as well as volunteers of non-health professionals. We have been implementing the programs in almost all 98 municipalities and at several hospitals in Denmark.  \n \nThis has also led to the co-founding of the European Network on Patient Empowerment, ENOPE - and also to involvement in a series of European projects related to self-management, self-care, and health literacy.", "industry_forums": "", "head_office_phone": "(+45)35265400", "level_of_interest": "European, national, regional/local", "relevant_communication": "\"Learn to live\"-courses implemented in Danish municipalities targeting issues such as living with diabetes, mental health (anxiety, depression), cancer, pain etc. \n \nCoordinator of the \"Together on Mental Health\" national partnership platform. \n \nCoordinator of the national School Health Data Service. \n \nProvider of health education about breastfeeding - and provider of apps with information about pregnancy, motherhood, fatherhood, parenting, breastfeeding etc. \n \nLead Coordinator of the joint health policy initiative at the Danish policy festival, Folkem\u00f8det. \n \nFounding partner in the Danish Council for Better Hygiene.  \n \n----------------- \nDanish representative in CHRODIS+, the JA for chronic diseases. \n \nFounding partner in ENOPE, European Network on Patient Empowerment. \n \nFounding partner in SCiE, Self-Care Initiative Europe.  \n \nFormer Lead of the PiSCE project (2014-2017 on self-care in minor ailments) and WP-leader in PRO STEP (2016-2018 on self-management in chronic diseases).", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2017", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "300000-399999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "6268389", "legal_status": "Association", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Lars M\u00fcnter", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "Lead Coordinator"}
