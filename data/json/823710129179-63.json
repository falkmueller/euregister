Freedom of the press and media is of vital importance for democratically organised states and open societies. Attacks on freedom of the media are attacks on freedom itself. The European Centre for Press and Media Freedom (ECPMF) was founded as an independent, non-profit European Co-operative Society (\"societas cooperativa Europaea\", SCE). The purpose of the SCE, which shall operate exclusively on a non-profit basis in the Federal Republic of Germany and other European countries, particularly in the European Union, is therefore the promotion, preservation and defence of freedom of the press and media by: \n \n(a) operating a centre to monitor violations of freedom of the press and media, the principles of which are anchored in the European Charter on Freedom of the Press;  \n(b) providing concrete and altruistic aid to defend against attacks on freedom of the press and media and to support the people and organisations affected thereby; \n(c) informing the public and policymakers in Europe about violations of freedom of the press and media; \n(d) organising suitable initiatives for the defence and enforcement of free media; \n(e) cooperating with persons and organisations who are working on a non-profit basis for the cause of free media; \n(f) creating scientific analyses concerning the implementation, endangering and violation of freedom of the press and media in individual countries and in Europe as a whole; \n(g) educating and training media professionals for the promotion of freedom of press and media; \n(h) holding conventions and other events which serve the purposes of the ECPMF; \n(i) awarding prizes and other distinctions to persons and organisations who have made an outstanding contribution to free media.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+49)34120040313"}
