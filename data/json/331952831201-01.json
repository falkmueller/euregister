Among our members are organisations of cannabis and other drug users, health workers, researchers, grassroots activists as well as companies. For one year, it is led by seven people who compose the Executive Committee. \n \nOur main goal is a change in the paradigm on Drugs Policy. ENCOD proposes the rational regulation of drugs, in models based on the health and the rights of drug users, emerging from the Civil Society proposals in a bottom-up frame. ENCOD wants to prevent the harms caused by the unrealistic prohibition on drugs and his negative consequences for user population, as the criminalization, the privacy of liberty or the administrative and social punishment, among other effects. \n \nENCOD defends the right of citizens to consume and obtain substances in a safe way, including the cultivation for personal use, safe distribution and access to trusted information and knowledge about the traditions, effects and possible risks of different substances.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+43)69912379086"}
