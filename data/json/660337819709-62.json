This led to the development of the Global LEI System which, through the issuance of LEIs, now provides unique identification of legal entities participating in financial transactions across the globe. The FSB emphasized that global adoption of the LEI underpins multiple \u201cfinancial stability objectives\u201d and also offers \u201cmany benefits to the private sector\u201d. \n  \nThe LEI is a 20-digit, alpha-numeric code based on the ISO 17442 standard developed by the International Organization for Standardization. The LEI connects to key reference information that enables clear and unique identification of legal entities participating in financial transactions. \n  \nEstablished by the FSB in June 2014, the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF) is a not-for-profit organization created to support the implementation and use of the LEI. GLEIF is headquartered in Basel, Switzerland. GLEIF services ensure the operational integrity of the Global LEI System. GLEIF also makes available the technical infrastructure to provide, via an open data license, access to the full global LEI repository free of cost to users. GLEIF is supervised by the LEI Regulatory Oversight Committee (ROC). The LEI ROC is a group of over 60 public authorities from more than 40 countries established in January 2013 to coordinate and oversee the Global LEI System.", "industry_forums": "", "inter_groups": "", "number_of_persons_involved": "2", "relevant_communication": "", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2017", "lat": 47.55479, "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "100000-199999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "6725587", "legal_status": "foundation", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Sven Schumacher", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "General Counsel", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+41)615087045"}
