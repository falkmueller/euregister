We seek to demonstrate what a world without poverty and suffering is like so that people can experience the reality of God's Kingdom first hand. This happens when people assume responsibility for themselves and others, so that they can lead worthy lives. \n \nKey values \n \nOur mission, vision and strategy revolve around five key values, which determine our choices at different levels and define our policy.
