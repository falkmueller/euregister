They can tackle society\u2019s biggest problems at the root, lay a foundation for change and play a crucial part in making the global development agenda a reality for all. That is why we want to help institutions and governments across Europe and Africa create policies that work.  \n \nOur independent policy experts contribute sharp analysis, thorough research and fresh ideas. But making policies work requires stepping off the sidelines too. It means working closely with the people who create, implement and are impacted by policies. We bring different groups around the table, smooth the way for debate and make sure that everyone\u2019s voice is heard. We provide advice and training and design practical solutions together.  \n \nWe have over thirty years of experience in development policy and international cooperation and know the African and European institutions inside out. Our focus is on EU foreign policy and European and African policies related to conflict, migration, governance, food security, regional integration, business, finance and trade. \n \nOur partners include officials from government ministries and institutions, international organisations, think tanks and academia, as well as social and economic actors from Africa, Europe and beyond.", "industry_forums": "", "inter_groups": "", "number_of_persons_involved": "38", "relevant_communication": "- Knowledge production: Weekly Compass newsletter, magazines (Great Insights), discussion papers, briefing notes, blogs, Challenges papers, joint publications, videos, interviews, etcetera \n \n- Presence in social media (LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, Youtube) and in newspapers (Euractiv, Devex, etcetera) \n \n- European Development Days: Participation in the 2018 European Development Days (as well as previous editions) and presentation during various sessions  \n \n- Support to EU Presidency \n \n- Content support, facilitation and participation to numerous events and seminars", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2017", "lat": 50.8471792, "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "6250000-6499999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "6254911", "legal_status": "foundation", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Geert Laporte", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "Deputy Director", "belgium_office_city": "Brussels", "head_office_phone": "(+31)043  350 29 00"}
