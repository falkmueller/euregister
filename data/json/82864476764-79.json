other workers in the media, entertainments and arts. In Europe, UNI MEI has 70 member organisations throughout the EU and other European countries. \n \nThe UNI MEI Secretariat based in Brussels serves as a point of contact for its affiliates and the members they represent in the increasingly internationalised creative industries. It is a clearing house for information useful to them, particularly that regarding binational or multinational productions, or movement of workers across national borders. It is concerned with issues ranging from ownership structural evolution, trade policy and technological change to copyright and neighbouring rights, piracy and censorship. It acts to exchange information about collective agreements, legal standards and practices.  \n \nUNI MEI Global Union represents the common positions of the categories it represents at an international level vis-\u00e0-vis employers and their associations and inter-governmental organisations, such as the EU Institutions. \n \nThe priorities of UNI MEI set by its General Assembly are: \n \nTo build strategic union power through implementation of strategic campaigns to ensure trade union rights and decent work in global and regional media and entertainment companies. We work towards a global framework agreement with global and regional media and entertainment companies.  \n \nTo grow unions and give a global dimension to trade union recruitment. We will give priority to organising campaigns assisting unions through organising projects and solidarity initiatives to win union access, recognition and agreements.   \n \n  \nTo raise employment standards by \n   \n\u2022    Extending the reach of collective representation and bargaining to all workers in the sector; \n\u2022    Campaigning for sustainable funding of public service broadcasting, film, live performance as well as fine arts in order to ensure the quality of employment and of programming in a changing technological environment; \n\u2022    Defending intellectual property rights and efficient, transparent collective management of rights; \n\u2022    Developing further the cooperation among affiliates with respect to working conditions with focus on equal opportunities, health and safety and training and \n\u2022    Building regional and global campaigns directed at companies and industry associations and within social dialogue on those issues to work towards better common standards. \n \nTo make effective social dialogue a reality in more companies and countries and at sector level. \n \nTo represent and make the voice of affiliates heard in regional and international policy making bodies affecting the sector with focus on ASEAN, EU, MERCOSUR and WIPO in order to establish coherent and inclusive audiovisual and cultural policies that favour growth and good & sustainable jobs in our industries, to improve the protection of intellectual property rights and remuneration of creators, to work towards sound state aid rules in broadcasting and film, and to defend the status of workers and their right to freedom of association.", "industry_forums": "", "head_office_phone": "(+322)2345652", "level_of_interest": "global", "relevant_communication": "", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2016", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "0-9999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "0", "legal_status": "association de fait", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Johannes Studinger", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "Head of UNI MEI"}
