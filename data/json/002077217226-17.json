Their individual members are professionals working in small and medium-sized accounting practices (SMPs), providing services primarily to Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs).  \n \nAccording to the European Commission's SME Performance Review, SMEs created the jobs for two out of three employees in the European Union and produced 58 cents of every euro of value added.  \n \nThat makes EFAA and its members the representatives for Europe's most important business advisors: SMPs. They help entrepreneurs gain access to finance and provide valued advice allowing them to grow their businesses sustainably. \n \nNonetheless, most accounting and auditing rules and standards set up at the EU or international level are inspired by large companies and oriented towards their interests.  \n \nThis is why EFAA strives to redress this imbalance and better represent SMPs' and SMEs' needs in Europe by providing regulators with in-depth knowledge and fact based perspective on SMPs and SMEs. \n \nEFAA has 17 members throughout Europe, representing more than 370.000 accountants and auditors.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+32)27368886"}
