This is achieved through our debates, conferences, working groups, reports and recommendations which provide bold and ambitious but practical solutions. We aim to be catalysts for change and believe that real solutions come from transforming mind-sets through the confrontation of ideas and the breaking down of silos between politicians, businesses and civil society. Believing that change is achieved through inclusive policies and action, we reach out to and work with a wide network of policymakers, international organisations, civil society representatives, business leaders, academics, the media and citizens across Europe and beyond. We have no national or party political bias and ensure that all viewpoints are represented in our activities and publications. We foster open, insightful and provocative debates to stimulate fresh ideas and creative thinking. Our portfolio of events and reports means that Friends of Europe contributes ideas and leads the debate on a wide range of EU-related issues. We offer Europe\u2019s citizens an opportunity to take an active transformational role in shaping their environment. We use ground-breaking online brainstorms to bring different stakeholder groups together from all over the world and constantly innovate in how we convene and shape discussions.", "industry_forums": "", "head_office_phone": "(+32)28939819", "level_of_interest": "European, global", "relevant_communication": "Projects = http://www.friendsofeurope.org/index.php/projects \n \nPublications = http://www.friendsofeurope.org/index.php/publications \n \nEvents = http://www.friendsofeurope.org/index.php/events \n \nEuropean Young Leaders (EYL40) programme = http://www.friendsofeurope.org/index.php/project/european-young-leaders \n \nEurope\u2019s World = http://www.friendsofeurope.org/index.php/europes-world \n \nDebating Europe = http://www.debatingeurope.eu/ \n \nState of Europe high-level roundtable = http://www.friendsofeurope.org/index.php/project/state-europe-annual-roundtable \n \nDebating Security Plus (DS+) = http://www.friendsofeurope.org/event/debating-security-plus-2018", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2017", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "3500000-3749000", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "3644249", "legal_status": "Asbl", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Geert Cami", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "Co-Founder and Managing Director"}
