U.Porto combines high quality education focused on individual vocations and talents as well as market needs with the claim to being the greatest birthplace of science in Portugal. It is committed to converting into social assets the talent and innovation from its 14 faculties, one business school and 50 research centres. U.Porto has the richest academic community in Portugal and brings together the country\u2019s highest ranked students, a highly qualified scientific and teaching staff and a growing number of international students, teachers and researchers. U.Porto\u2019s fully equipped campus embedded within the city guarantees an optimal academic, scientific, and also social and cultural experience. Being open to the community and business is the main trademark of U.Porto. The University is itself an important driving force for economic, social, cultural and scientific development in Northern Portugal and in the country as a whole. U.Porto creates leaders, promotes innovators and encourages entrepreneurs. In short, it trains people who can make a difference in their communities. \nThe knowledge and skills conveyed to U.Porto students is vast, diversified, and future-oriented.  The University's cycles of studies \u2013 1st cycle (bachelor) and integrated master, 2nd cycle (master), 3rd cycle (doctorate) and lifelong learning \u2013 cover the main scientific domains and the most relevant fields of study. \nU. Porto has been registering twice as many candidates as the number of available vacancies on the national competition for access to higher education. Every year, the number of foreign students has increased. This is proof of U.Porto\u2019s international reputation. The University has been chosen as a first option by foreign students from all five continents. U.Porto's current position in international higher education and academic research rankings is one of the reasons why it has been so sought after. \nTo ensure better teaching, U.Porto has a highly qualified and specialized teaching and research staff, mostly doctorates. The University's human resources also include highly-qualified administrative and technical officers, who are responsible for maintaining the institution fully operational and, to a fair extent, successful.  \nThe quality of U.Porto's teaching is strengthened by a close connection to scientific research, local businesses, cultural and arts institutions, as well as museums, and the two central city hospitals. Therefore, the learning process extends far beyond the classroom. In fact, its technical, scientific, and multidisciplinary nature makes it more appropriate for social and professional challenges. That is also why U.Porto diplomas are highly acknowledged and trusted by employers, thus promoting an effective integration of our students in the national and international labour market.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+351)220 408 000"}
