It was established in 1958 with the following aims and purposes:  \n \n\u2022    To advance the understanding of international and comparative law; \n\u2022    To promote the rule of law in international affairs; and  \n\u2022    To promote their application through research, publications and events. \n \nThe Institute is an independent and authoritative voice in research, contemporary debate and policy-making on international and comparative legal issues.  Our priorities for research evolve in line with contemporary global developments and concerns, changing needs in legal practice, responses to invitations to tender and international engagements.  We disseminate our research via our widely-respected journal, the International and Comparative Law Quarterly (ICLQ), books and other publications as well as our established programme of seminars and events.  We also apply our research through training and capacity-building activities. \n \nThe Institute has a diverse membership comprising legal practitioners (including judges, solicitors, barristers and in-house counsel), lawyers from the academic community, representatives from government and non-governmental organisations, as well as many others who are interested in international and comparative law. This membership allows our researchers direct access to many key practitioners, officials and judges in the various fields, some of whom act as advisers to the research projects undertaken by the Institute. It also means that the Institute\u2019s research and events are based on deep scholarly knowledge and strong practical experience, so that our findings can be applied to real world situations.  Our seminars and events are generally open to the public and non-members usually comprise the majority of attendees. \n \nBIICL has a team of around eighteen research staff, many of whom are highly experienced in both scholarly work and in legal practice, and a similar number of professional support staff.  Each year the Institute also welcomes a wide range of distinguished scholars as Visiting Fellows, as well as volunteer interns who are typically undertaking higher degrees.  We are committed to encouraging and supporting the best scholarship and talent in our fields. \n \nBIICL has significant expertise both in conducting complex legal research, and in communicating it to a wider audience.   Our principal areas of research are comparative law, competition law, European Union law, international human rights law, international investment law, private international law, public international law, and the rule of law, as well as interactions between these areas.  Our research is grounded in strong conceptual foundations with an applied focus, which seeks to provide practical solutions, examples of good practice and recommendations for future policy changes and legal actions.  Much of our research crosses over into other disciplines and areas of policy, which requires us to ensure that our research is accessible to non-lawyers. This includes, for example, drafting concise and user-friendly briefing papers on the implications of various domestic and EU legislative proposals or adopted directives, regulations, treaties etc for a target audience with varying levels of knowledge and experience of law.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+44)2078625151"}
