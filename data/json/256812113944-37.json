Shrinking congregations, financial distress and lack of knowledge about conserving the buildings and treasures held within them, all contribute to this impeding loss of a substantial collection of testaments to European history and intangible heritage. FRH was formed with support from numerous organisations in several European countries to create a unified voice for the many European organisations that are working hard to mitigate the detrimental consequences of this trend for religious heritage. FRH acts as a link between practitioners and policymakers and as a platform for communication across countries, cultures and religions, exchanging knowledge and experience of common issues.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+32)24007703"}
