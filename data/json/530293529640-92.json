When considering more advanced engineering phases, we mostly dedicate to power cable design, installation engineering, planning, preparation and evaluation of EPCI tender processes, and project and construction management. \n \n- R&D \n  KSS bears R&D in its DNA. We have been very active in that field and have initiated several projects. The most recent one is the development of a cable monitoring services. Under the name of CALICYA (Cable Life Cycle Assurance),  KSS and its partner company FEBUS Optics, offers high accuracy Distributed Strain Sensing equipment to monitor power cable integrity as they are being manufactured, installed and operated.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+33)564111130"}
