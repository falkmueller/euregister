It represents stakeholders of both the fishing sector (including catching, processing and marketing sectors, and trade unions), and other groups of interest (environmental and development for cooperation NGOs and civil society). It is currently composed by 52 members from 12 EU coastal Member States. It is recognised in the CFP Regulation (UE) No 1380/2013 as an organization aiming a European Interest. \n \nIts mission is to provide advice to the European Commission and to the EU Member States on matters related to Fisheries Agreements with Third Countries, relations with Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs) in which the EU is a contracting party, or with international organizations in whose waters the Community Fleet is operating, as well as other horizontal and cross-cutting issues such as international ocean governance, blue growth, or coherence between different EU policies related to fisheries (namely cooperation for development, labour, health and trade).  \n \nIts main goal is to promote the conservation of marine biodiversity and the sustainable use of fishing resources.  \n \nMore specifically, it is focused on three key areas of work: \n \n1. Fighting against Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing.  \nThe LDAC is actively engaged with the European Commission, the Member States, the European Fisheries Control Agency (EFCA), industry, R&D companies and NGOs on this topic.  \n \n2. Promoting the components of the external dimension of the CFP and its coordination with EU environmental, development for cooperation, health and trade policies. Seeking for compliance of international legal instruments in the promotion of human and labour rights of fish workers and across the entire fishing value chain. \n \n3. Improving transparency and governance in decision making in fisheries management in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans; and advocating for enhanced participation of fisheries stakeholders in international fora (e.g. UN, FAO, IUCN, OECD, ILO, RFMOs...)", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+34)914323623"}
