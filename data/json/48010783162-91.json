These will vary but currently include the implementation of the Construction Products Directive, fire protection in construction, the environment and raw materials. It provides contact for its Members with European governmental institutions as well as with other construction industry associations: architects, contractors, developers, etc. It also liaises with European construction materials sectorial organisations, the majority of which have joined Construction Products Europe as Associate Members. \n \nConstruction Products Europe monitors European legislative, administrative and economic measures affecting the construction materials and building products industry, and ensures, whenever possible, that the industry's interests are taken into account. To achieve this, it strives to obtain from its Members consensual industry views on important pan-European issues. \n \nOn 1st January 2018, Construction Products Europe represents 18 full members and 33 associate members (list available on our web site).", "industry_forums": "", "head_office_phone": "(+32)24634957", "level_of_interest": "European", "relevant_communication": "Publications 2016-2014 \n- EBC/FIEC/CPE Joint Press release 'Construction Industry and Materials Producers join forces for better standardisation (June 2016) \n- Joint Initiative on Standardisation (June 2016) \n- FIEC/CPE Joint Position Paper on Standardisation (April 2016) \n- FIEC/CPE Joint Poition Paper on Market Surveillance (April 2016) \n- FIEC/CPE Joint Press release 'Standardisation and market surveillance at risk of going off track (April 2016) \n- EPD challenges (December 2015) \n- Circular economy analysis (December 2015) \n- EDA Newsletter (September 2015) \n- Standardisation on the CPR (July 2015) \n- Position paper on reuse of construction products (19/12/2014) \n- EOTA \u2013 Implementation of the CPR Position Paper (28/11/2014) \n- Position Paper on the Market Surveillance (24/03/2014) \n- Ecodesign Position Paper (06/01/2014) \n \nEvents 2016-2014 \n- CPE/EDA Special CDW meeting (21/01/2016) \n- Towards Smart CE Marking for Construction Products (22/03/2016) \n- CPE Strategy meeting (17/05/2016) \n- Workshop 'LCA information and CE marking (29/06/2016) \n- Brainstorming session 'Smart CE marking' (07/09/2016) \n- Workshop 'Resource Efficiency (22/11/2016) \n- EPD, Current degate and challenges (10/12/2015) \n- EC Fitness check & CPR implementation studies (12/11/2015) \n- Adaptation to climate change, from cities to buildings (28/10/2015) \n- Standardisation under the construction products regulation (28/04/2015) \n- Sustainability Assessment Workshop (14/10/2014) \n- How to establish good working relationship with new MEPs Workshop (27/06/2014) \n- Workshop on the exchange of information across the supply chain (30/04/2014) \n- China Delegation visit at Construction Products Europe (25/04/2014) \n- Sustainability Assessment Methodologies Workshop (04/03/2014)", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2016", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "100000-199999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "0", "legal_status": "AISBL", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Christophe SYKES", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "Director General"}
