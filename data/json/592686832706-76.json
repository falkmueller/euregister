This facilitates collaboration between service providers and device manufacturers, empowering them to ensure adequate security within all devices to protect against threats. \n \nGlobalPlatform specifications also standardize the secure management of digital services and devices once deployed in the field. Altogether, GlobalPlatform enables convenient and secure digital service delivery to end users, while supporting privacy, regardless of market sector or device type. Devices secured by GlobalPlatform include connected cars, set top boxes, smart cards, smartphones, tablets, wearables, and other Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. \n \nThe technology\u2019s widespread global adoption delivers cost and time-to-market efficiencies to all. Market sectors adopting GlobalPlatform technology include automotive, healthcare, government and enterprise ID, payments, premium content, smart cities, smart home, telecoms, transportation and utilities. \n \nGlobalPlatform\u2019s legacy of successful technical specification development is thanks to two decades of energetic and effective industry collaboration.
