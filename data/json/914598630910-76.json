Following a 21 month battle with the disease he passed away 9 days before his 6th birthday. We wanted to find something positive in our tragedy and thought long and hard about the direction we should take. \nWe feel strongly that new treatments are urgently needed for the 20% of children who do not survive their disease along with those children who survive but face a lifetime of post treatment issues. \nChristopher\u2019s Smile does not have a specific paediatric tumour focus but instead provides funding for projects that will benefit the largest number of children possible across the childhood cancer community. The charity has awarded 6 project grants and raised over 1 million pounds. \nThe current research funding focus of Christopher\u2019s Smile is the development of tumour DNA sequencing for the analysis of tissue and fluid samples.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+44)1276475319"}
