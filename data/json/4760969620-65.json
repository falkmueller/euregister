Introduction \n \nThe Council of Bars and Law Societies of Europe (CCBE) represents the bars and law societies of 32 member countries and 13 further associate and observer countries, and through them more than 1 million European lawyers. \n  \nThe CCBE was founded in 1960, as the ramifications of the European Economic Community on the legal profession started to be seriously considered (see the CCBE\u2019s History). During the decades which followed and through to the present day, the CCBE has been in the forefront of advancing the views of European lawyers and defending the legal principles upon which democracy and the rule of law are based. The CCBE is an international non-profit-making association incorporated in Belgium. \n  \nThe CCBE is recognised as the voice of the European legal profession by the national bars and law societies on the one hand, and by the EU institutions on the other. It acts as the liaison between the EU and Europe's national bars and law societies. The CCBE has regular institutional contacts with those European Commission officials, and members and staff of the European Parliament, who deal with issues affecting the legal profession . Its current strategy can be found here. \n  \nIn addition, the CCBE works closely with legal organisations outside Europe. \n \n \nII.    Objectives: \n \nA non-profit making organisation, the CCBE represents European bars and law societies in their common dealings before European and other international institutions. \nA particular feature of the CCBE's work is its focus on European cross-border matters as they affect lawyers. The CCBE was closely consulted by the European Commission in relation to the promulgation of a series of European directives, which regulate the way that lawyers can practise in other Member States, either by way of temporary services, establishment or re-qualification.  \nAmong the most important of the CCBE's missions are the defence of the rule of law, human rights and democratic values. Of special concern are the rights of access to justice, and the protection of the client by ensuring respect for the core values of the profession.  \nThere are many other issues which affect lawyers at the European level: the impact of competition law on the profession's core values; the relationship between the duties of lawyers (and through them, the rights of citizens) and the duties of governments to provide security for citizens; the impact of globalisation and market liberalisation on the legal profession. All these matters form part of the central, day-to-day work of the CCBE.  \nThe CCBE also represents its members in their dealings with other lawyers' organisations around the world on issues of common interest to the legal profession, such as the fight against terrorism and other serious crime, and the ability of lawyers globally to practise their profession freely without harassment or hindrance.", "industry_forums": "", "inter_groups": "", "number_of_persons_involved": "7", "relevant_communication": "- Participation in the Me-CODEX project \n- Evidence2e-CODEX projects \n- Find-a-lawyer 3 project \n \n- Publications: http://www.ccbe.eu/documents/publications/  \n- Position papers: http://www.ccbe.eu/documents/position-papers/?no_cache=1", "financial_year_end_date": "01/11/2017", "lat": 50.84585389999999, "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "400000-499999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "0", "legal_status": "International non-profit-making association (aisbl)", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Simone Cuomo", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "Senior Legal Advisor", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+32)234 65 10"}
