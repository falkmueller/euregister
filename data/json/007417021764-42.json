This includes increases in production efficiency as well as re-using production waste as input material were possible. \nThe DPP network is developing multiple strategies that each focus on optimising phosphorus use efficiency, recycling rates and substitution potential to work towards the combined goal of sustainable phosphorus use throughout Germany.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+49)1712269953"}
