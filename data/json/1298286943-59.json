The association works in all of the application fields of modern biotechnology, including healthcare, agriculture and food production, and industrial biotechnology. \n \nMembers of EuropaBio are involved in research, development, testing, manufacturing and commercialisation of biotechnology products and processes. Our corporate members have a wide range of activities: human and animal health care, diagnostics, bio-informatics, chemicals, crop protection, agriculture, food and environmental products and services. \n \n \n \nEuropaBio also welcomes associate members such as international commercial, financial, asset management and other service-providing companies, regional biotechnology development organisations and scientific institutes. The common denominator among all our members is the use of biotechnology at any stage of research, development or manufacturing. \n \n \n \nWe stand for free and open markets and the removal of barriers to competitiveness with other areas of the world. \n \n \n \nWe are committed to open, informed communications with all stakeholders and the general public about the ethical, social and economic aspects of biotechnology and its applications. \n \n \n \nWe champion the responsible use of biotechnology to ensure that its potential is fully used to the benefit of the environment and mankind. \n \n \n \nSectors of particular interest include: agricultural, food, healthcare, environmental, industrial and innovation policy. As biotechnology is strongly based on innovation developed in start-up and small companies, policies related to the promotion of SMEs in the EU are a focus of attention. Biotechnology is a knowledge-based sector, and policies related to intellectual property rights are another important focus of attention.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+32)27350313"}
