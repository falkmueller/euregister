It is known informally as The European Consumer Voice in Standardisation, and uses the strapline Raising Standards for Consumers. \n \nANEC is recognised by the European Commission and EFTA as the European association representing the interests of consumers in standardisation, in line with Annex III to Regulation (EU) 1025/2012 on European standardisation. Its partnership with the European Commission is formalised through Framework Partnership Agreement 143/G/CONSUMER/ENTR/2014 and, with EFTA, through Framework Partnership Agreement FPA/ANEC/EFTA/2015.  \n \nIts principal aim is to promote, defend and represent the interests of consumers in the work of the three European Standards Organisations (CEN, CENELEC and ETSI) and in similar organisations whose technical standards, specifications or guidance documents may affect consumers, directly or indirectly. The European Standardisation Organisations are private associations and there is no fundamental reason why their standards development work should take into account the public interest. Bearing in mind the support European Standards give to the implementation of European legislation and other public polices, ANEC was established  to provide an effective and coherent representation at European level of disparate and fragmented national consumer interests. \n \nANEC also represents the consumer interest in the drafting or revision of European legislation - especially within the context of the New Legislative Framework for products - and in the development of public policies that may make reference to standards. \n \nAnd ANEC also represents the collective European consumer interest in European fora addressing the use of standards and in matters of conformity assessment. \n \nEach member country of the EU and EFTA (and certain other European countries) may nominate a natural person to represent the interests of national consumer organisations in his or her country in the governance of ANEC. This individual is chosen by consensus at national level. The technical work of ANEC is pursued through topic-specific Working Groups bringing together volunteers from the member countries. The day-to-day management of the association, and promotion of its activities, is pursued by the ANEC Secretariat, based in Brussels. \n \nIn 2017, ANEC participated in more than 175 technical bodies of CEN, CENELEC and ETSI, and more than 25 technical bodies of ISO and IEC.", "industry_forums": "", "head_office_phone": "(+32)27432470", "level_of_interest": "European", "relevant_communication": "Explanatory video about ANEC https://goo.gl/5TTJ6H \nANEC Annual Review https://goo.gl/tx3LGA \nANEC e-Newsletter https://goo.gl/cQVjI0 \nANEC Brochure, \"What we do for you\" https://goo.gl/aopL3m \n \nANEC Position Papers & similar https://goo.gl/iLYVZn", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2017", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "50000-99999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "1440853", "legal_status": "AISBL", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Stephen Russell", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "Secretary-General"}
