Membership is open to legal professionals (lawyers, judges), academics and law students. \n \nThe objectives of the organisation are: \n \nTo develop co-operation and networking of personal injury lawyers within Europe; \nTo promote access to the legal system for consumers suffering personal injury; \nTo promote higher standards of care and safety for consumers; \nTo promote proper and fair compensation for all personal injury cases; \nTo support and encourage the exchange of information and knowledge. \nThe development and expansion of PEOPIL is based upon recognition that the issues involved in personal injury litigation frequently extend beyond the national boundaries and require an international perspective and knowledge. \n \nThe impact of EC legislation on personal injury law is growing steadily and this creates a need for knowledge of European legislation and a basic understanding of the Member States legislation in this field.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+44)1216434962"}
