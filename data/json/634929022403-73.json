The ECF with its specialist working groups and its wider network provides expertise for a European harmonisation during the regular dialogues it maintains with legislators, regulators and other European and international authorities at Brussels or Geneva.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+4969)7040390"}
