The company has published and developed some National and European R&D projects related to advanced raw material treatment technologies. This experience has allowed CEINNMAT to create a new electromagnetic metallurgy (EM) treatment processes as well heating technology of continuous flow based on microwave. EM technology will increase process efficiency and productivity, reduce environmental impact and the human health risk, as well as increasing the economic benefits for EU countries, becoming a valuable opportunity for the raw materials market suitable for a wide range of materials according with their complex permittivity and permeability. EM technology has technical features of high added value as to be implemented in places with limited infrastructure, such as no water dependent, modularity in design, flexibility, versatility and portability with electrical energy only that provide even more potentiality for fast instruction into the market (see picture of one of the pilot facilities built on the right below). \nHigh and low temperature microwave equipment has been developed during last years in cooperation with collaborators considering the properties and conditions of the material treated.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+34)963640257"}
