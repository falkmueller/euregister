Indeed, the scale of these challenges requires full commitment from all actors with a stake in Europe\u2019s success, and AGE believes that civil society has a unique contribution to make in realising this aim and in building a new confidence in the EU as a force for prosperity, solidarity, security and equal opportunity for all in Europe \n \nAGE\u2019s work is mainly targeted at our members as well as external stakeholders such as European institutions,  national and local public authorities, European social NGOs and social partners, and other relevant parties working in the field of ageing and human rights. \n \nAGE aims to become the key network representing senior citizens across the EU and for that we want to develop our capacity to respond to the rapidly growing request for co-operation from external institutions: public authorities at EU, national regional and local levels, universities, researchers, social partners, industry, and other NGOs.  \n \nAGE believes that older and/or retired people should be able to speak out on their own behalf. To this end, AGE places great importance on their leadership and active involvement in all of its activities. To implement this principle, our internal structure is developed in a democratic way, with a General Assembly, elected Council and Executive Committee, designated Accreditation Committee and Experts Groups and an appointed Secretariat, to ensure that our members are actively involved in our work.  Our main working method is networking and alliance building.   \n \nAGE works to build a more effective civil dialogue at European, national, regional and local level and seeks to ensure that this dialogue recognises and takes account of the needs and expectations of older people across the EU and of their great social and cultural diversity.", "industry_forums": "", "head_office_phone": "(+32)22801470", "level_of_interest": "European", "relevant_communication": "Projects: see http://www.age-platform.eu/age-projects \n \nCalendar: http://www.age-platform.eu/calendar-node-field-event-date/year \n \nNewsletter: http://www.age-platform.eu/newsletter-coverage \n \nKey events: \nAGE Annual Conference 2018: http://www.age-platform.eu/event/age-annual-conference-2018", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2017", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "600000-699999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "1216310", "legal_status": "asbl", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Anne-Sophie Parent", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "Secretary General"}
