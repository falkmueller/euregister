Its mission is to enable socially progressive voices to be heard in the policy circles of the United Nations, Westminster, Brussels and beyond. \n \nSocially progressive organisations make a huge difference in alleviating inequality and injustice and empowering people to make a difference to their communities and their environment. But whether they are dealing with homelessness, youth disengagement or environmental degradation, they are usually far less equipped to influence policy and have their voices heard on the corridors of power than business lobbies and a myriad of other political and commercial interest groups. \n \nMy consultancy seeks to redress this imbalance. Its mission is to share political and communications expertise acquired in international politics, as well as in the NGO and private sectors in the UK. It strives to arm organisations making a difference to the world we live in with the skills and savvy that are needed to secure policy change and high-level political support. \n \nMy areas of specialist expertise include, among others, food and agriculture, international development, animal health and welfare, gender, human rights, sustainability and One Health. \n \nI provide: \n \n-political consultancy and policy research \n-strategy development \n-communications advice and project management \n-event management \n-UN, EU, international and UK lobbying", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+44)7531741480"}
