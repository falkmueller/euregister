All student unions in Finnish universities are members of SYL. A student union is a public corporation which is governed by the Universities Act.  \n \nThe voice of students \nWe promote students\u2019 interests and speak for the younger generation in society. We are where student issues are discussed, from the parliament to barricades. \n  \nBrilliant student benefits \nWe offer the best student benefits in Finland to our members through Frank, a student-owned service. Every student who belongs to a student union is also our member and entitled to student discounts. \n  \nCompetencies for the future \nEveryone\u2019s opportunities to educate themselves, learn and develop themselves through life are issues close to our heart. We make sure education and the education system are developed from this starting point to ensure competencies for the future. \n \nStudent wellbeing \nWe work to ensure that all students would feel well \u2013 both now and in the future. The Finnish Student Health Service (FSHS) is responsible for student health care. FSHS was founded by SYL. In addition, SYL is a member in many organisations which promote the wellbeing of students. \n  \nPrerequisites for student life \nWe work to make sure that students have affordable housing and enough money to live on. The amount of the student financial aid, that there are enough student apartments all over Finland and subsidised student meals are important issues for us. \n  \nAdvocacy work in the European Union \nWe defend students\u2019 interests in the European Union. We stay alert in both the Commission and the Parliament and ensure that the voice of Finnish students is heard in Europe. \n \nGlobal responsibility \nWe recognise our global responsibility for the environment and human welfare. We have a long tradition and competence in development cooperation and we work passionately for it. \n  \nResearch as a starting point for the advocacy work \nWe are an expert in education and student life. We influence decision-makers by offering current information on students. For this purpose, we utilise, for instance, our cooperation partner Research Foundation for Studies and Education Otus.", "industry_forums": "", "head_office_phone": "(+358)0407539099", "level_of_interest": "European, national", "relevant_communication": "", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2017", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "50000-99999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "1031895", "legal_status": "Student organisation", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Maria Nyroos", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "International affairs and EU advocacy adviser"}
