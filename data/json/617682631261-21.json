We organize help for the poorest people who struggle with social exclusion, as well as victims of military conflicts, natural disasters and epidemics. \nThe Polish Humanitarian Team was founded in July 2016 by a small group of volunteers who had coordinated help in a refugee camp in Idomeni, Greece. Some of us have extensive professional experience organizing help in Poland and abroad, while for other members the journey on this path has just started. \nWe provide humanitarian and development assistance and carry out social and educational programs, working in areas with structural poverty and in social conflict zones. We also work with refugees. At the same time we organize groups of volunteers and conduct training about tolerance and human rights.", "industry_forums": "", "head_office_phone": "(+48)533231886", "level_of_interest": "European, global", "relevant_communication": "Aid projects in Ukraine", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2016", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "849000", "legal_status": "Foundation", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Katarzyna Ewa Corominas", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "President"}
