European Commission Impact Assessment \n \nMotivation: \nGenerally, we feel that EU policies, although well-written, are not adequately reflected/implemented at the state(s) level. \n \na) Sometimes, the root of the problem might be at the regional level (e.g. corruption) -- then it is useful to remember this at the EU level and set the EU policies adequately to mitigate (e.g. expect corruption and prepare audit controls to reveal the corruption). \n \nb) Sometimes, the problem might arise from inadequate synchronization/cooperation between EU institutions.  \n \nFor example, European Investment Bank is funding a project of bypass in Bratislava, which is problematic from both a) corruption b) not following the EU sustainable transport policies. This project might negatively influence the transport situation in Bratislava; bring more cars, noise and emissions into the city. \n \nAnother two NGOs (INEKO and Nadacia Zastavme korupciu) were filing a complaint with EIB to investigate the concerns (cf. EIB reference reference SG /E/2015/16). Our NGO filed a complaint addressed to the Prosecutor General in Slovakia and we plan to address the issue at EU level to prevent similar cases in future. \n \nWe also feel that there is a need to make EU processes more transparent and efficient.", "organisation_name": "Cyklokoal\u00edcia (Cycling Coalition)", "belgium_office_post_code": "", "number_of_persons_involved": "20", "procurement": "", "section": "III - Non-governmental organisations", "source": "", "belgium_office_address": "", "subsection": "Non-governmental organisations, platforms and networks and similar", "belgium_office_phone": "", "number_of_ep_accredited_persons": "", "overall_budget_turnover_as_a_range": "", "belgium_office_city": "", "persons_accredited_for_access_to_european_parliament_premises": "", "estimate_of_costs_absolute_amount": "", "registration_date": "09/04/2016", "website_address": "http://www.cyklokoalicia.sk", "commission_expert_groups_and_other_similar_entities_european_commission": "NA", "head_office_post_box": "", "head_office_city": "Bratislava", "membership": "Cyklistick\u00e1 Aliancia (initiative)", "head_office_post_code": "", "goals__remit": "Cycling Coalition (Cyklokoalicia in Slovak) is a non-profit organization that aims to improve bicycle infrastructure.

Our goal is to see more bicycles in the city, better walkability, and better overall traffic flow for all forms of transport.

Together with other organizations, we managed to include provisions which improve the safety of cyclists into the Slovak transportation law. \n \nWe would love to convince the decision makers in Slovakia to focus more on sustainable transport.
