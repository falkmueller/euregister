It is the voice of Europe's national energy regulators at EU and international level. Through CEER,  the national regulators cooperate and exchange best practice.   \n \nThe overall aim of the Council of European Energy Regulators (CEER) is to facilitate the creation of a single, competitive, efficient and sustainable internal market for gas and electricity in Europe and ensure the EU Energy market delivers benefits to consumers. The CEER acts as a platform for cooperation, information exchange and assistance between Europe's national energy regulators and is their interface at EU and international level. On EU issues, CEER works very closely with (and supports) the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER), an EU Agency formed for the cooperation of energy regulators. \n \nCEER also strives to share regulatory best practice worldwide through its membership of the International Confederation of Energy Regulators (ICER) which brings together similar associations from across the globe including NARUC (America), ERRA (Central/Eastern Europe) and MEDREG (the Mediterranean region).", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+32)27887330"}
