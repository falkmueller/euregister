All our activities are connected to our guiding principles. We initiate and support cultural exchange and creative expression across wider Europe. ECF shares and connects knowledge across the European cultural sector, and advocates for arts and culture on all levels of political decision-making. We link policy and practice, to act as catalysts for artistic and cultural expression and to have a concrete impact on European cultural policies and strategies. We do this through our programmes, grants, advocacy, publications and digital platforms. \n \nECF's vision is that the connecting power of culture is essential for creating open, inclusive and democratic societies, and as such is invaluable for building Europe. \n \nOur mission is to support cultural expression and interaction that empower people to realise a shared future in Europe. We enable voices that are too often unheard to be heard. We link inspirational people and ideas to cultural policy making both in local communities and on the European political stage. \n \nhttps://www.culturalfoundation.eu", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+31)205733868"}
