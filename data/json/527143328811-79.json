Lead in the application of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs), in the area of workers\u2019 rights with a primary emphasis on corporate responsibility to respect human rights through multi-stakeholder engagement and robust due diligence processes;   \n2.    to promote freedom of association and collective bargaining which is a critical element of ETI\u2019s approach to due diligence, as it enables workers themselves to negotiate their own terms and conditions of work, and provides a structured mechanism through which workers\u2019 grievances and access to remedy can operate; \n3.    Supporting an emerging international network of ethical trade platforms  \n4.    Strengthen ETI members\u2019 accountability and transparency in implementing the ETI base code  \n5.
