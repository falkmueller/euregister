I wrote annual reports disseminated individually and on the TN\u2019s websites where they can still be found. \nIn addition, I was directly responsible for all the language learning work packages and deliverables in each of these Thematic Networks, as well as the major provider of all the LifeLong Learning work carried out in these projects. \n(AQUATNET \u2013Aquatic sciences thematic network  (SOCRATES 225997-CP 1-2005-1-FR-ERASMUS-TN) \nAQUATNET - Aquaculture, Fisheries & Aquatic Resource Management TN (142245-LLP-1-2008-1-BE-ERASMUS-ENW) \nAQUATNET-  Promoting innovation and a European dimension through Lifelong learning in the field of Aquaculture, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Management \n(518700-LLP-1-2011-1-UK-ERASMUS-ENW) \n \nThe WAVE project (WAVE \u2013 Workers in Aquaculture /Validation of Experience IRL/03/B/F/PP-153112(2003-2006) targeted the aquaculture industry throughout Europe - the workers and employers in SMEs, trade associations, colleges and training organisations, and mapped the actual skills and knowledge needed for work in the sector. Using a bottom-up approach by interviewing 90 companies in 10 countries, the WAVE project produced a Master List of Skills, Competences and Knowledge for the sector. It was my function within the WAVE project  to describe these in terms to Learning Outcomes to facilitate  the accreditation process. I also produced the WAVE dedicated glossary of specific educational terminology languages (English, French, Spanish, German, Italian, Norwegian, Danish, Greek, Dutch, Czech) \nMy current involvement in the EU 2020 ESCO Initiative is based on my experience and use of WAVE Master List of Competences. \nThe VALLA project (VALLA (Validation of all Lifelong Learning in Aquaculture)   2007/10342 /TRA EQF/ IE/EACEA) created an online tool to validate and recognize short-term sectoral training (including non-formal learning). Using a competence-based approach VALLA helped to build transparency and trust in the European Qualifications Framework, by providing an occupational map for the sector. The VALLA tool, in which I played a major part, was designed to allow trainers to describe their courses in terms of competence-based learning outcomes Its beneficiaries were: providers of training and education, job market entrants and employees; experienced workers with more skills and competences than any degree could provide were able to demonstrate their true worth in the job market; young graduates who could add unaccredited work experience/short courses to their CVs.  \nIn addition, I was responsible for the creation of the educational website PESCALEX (www.pescalex.org) with its unique Fish Health Toolset with Fish Health/Diseases courses in English, Greek, French, Spanish, Norwegian, Polish, dedicated multi-lingual glossary (English, Greek, French, Spanish, Norwegian, Polish), its language learning tool (CLIL) modules in English, Greek French, Spanish, Norwegian, Polish. \nI ran a 2-day Dissemination Workshop in Poland and a 3-day student language learning workshop \nIn France using a Language Learning Simulation Game on Fish diseases which I designed and implemented. I was involved in the organising and running of a student workshop in Spain, another simulation game which was based on the use of keywords to stimulate language learning.", "organisation_name": "Margaret Eleftheriou (Marelef)", "belgium_office_post_code": "", "number_of_persons_involved": "1", "procurement": "", "section": "III - Non-governmental organisations", "source": "", "belgium_office_address": "", "subsection": "Non-governmental organisations, platforms and networks and similar", "belgium_office_phone": "", "number_of_ep_accredited_persons": "", "overall_budget_turnover_as_a_range": "", "belgium_office_city": "", "persons_accredited_for_access_to_european_parliament_premises": "", "estimate_of_costs_absolute_amount": "0", "registration_date": "28/11/2016", "website_address": "http://www.aqualex.org", "commission_expert_groups_and_other_similar_entities_european_commission": "Skills development and careers in the blue economy#E03399#http://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regexpert/index.cfm?do=groupDetail.groupDetail&groupID=3399#Member#B#Other", "head_office_post_box": "", "head_office_city": "Dublin", "membership": "", "head_office_post_code": "Dublin 8", "goals__remit": "As a self-employed consultant in the education field I am strongly committed to the development of interactive learning related to the application of new technologies in the area of the aquatic sciences, including aquaculture. These concern language learning tools, multi-lingual databases, e-learning aquatic science course materials, as in the 27-country Europe linguistic competency skills are vitally important. As a former HE academic language lecturer, my main aim is as follows: a) to enable European scientists to participate with confidence in today\u2019s multilingual scientific community; b) to help build a multilingual framework of aquatic science materials which will help them to communicate fluently in those European languages important for the aquatic sciences, including the less widely spoken languages; c) to provide self-instructional language modules in English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Norwegian, Swedish, Polish, Greek, Hungarian, Turkish and d) to provide Language for Specific Purposes (fish health) e-learning multilingual materials in English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Norwegian, Swedish, Polish, Greek, Hungarian, Turkish. I continue to develop and pilot several innovative language games and iMovies in several languages My activities as consultant are aimed towards the continuous development and improvement of the AQUALEX aquaculture glossary which already exists in 10 languages and in online formats, the PESCALEX online glossary of Fish Diseases  (10 languages) and the Marine Pollution glossary (4 languages). I continue my work as part-time consultant in technology transfer and ERASMUS initiatives such as MATES project and Expert Group on Skills and Careers in the blue Economy.

The work that I had carried out over the years in the WAVE and VALLA projects, with their competence-based approach in describing the skills and knowledge needed in aquaculture and the marine sciences was of great benefit to the Reference Group, which was one of the first four to be established by the ESCO Secretariat.  The Reference Group met frequently up to 2015, after which much of the work has been done online, in populating the very extensive ESCO database which npw contains a structured terminology on occupations, skills/competences and qualifications from 28 Reference Groups  \nESCO is intended to enhance regional mobility and thus help to fight unemployment. The European Commission anticipates that the ESCO  database will become a backbone for the EU wide exchange of information relevant for the labour market. \nPublications \nELEFTHERIOU, M.1984.In \"The changing face of education 14-16: curriculum & assessment\", Eds.
