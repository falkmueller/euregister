The scale and visible nature of the plastic pollution problem has captured grassroots imagination like no other environmental issue. Current initiatives are generally populist and reactionary, based on feel good efforts that capture headlines, but aren\u2019t addressing the full scale of the problem. Consequentially, demonisation of plastic has been normalised with a focus on the end of life phase, and the utility of plastic is being forgotten.  \n \nAt Polymateria, we fully embrace the circular economy and support the reduction of single-use plastic, the reuse of long-life durable plastic and a more effective recycling system. These all inform where we focus and deploy our technology however, we appreciate that all systems leak, so the 4th \u2018R\u2019 is where Polymateria operates: Redesign. We transform plastics at the point of manufacture to ensure that the products biodegrade in the natural environment after their useful life \n \nPolymateria sells its technology through licence agreements with large operators and manufacturers, delivering bespoke technology in the form of masterbatch additives.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+44)2037132944"}
