Together with our partners, we believe in respectful, non-judgemental community dialogue around issues of FGC. We currently support partners working within communities in Kenya, India and Senegal. \n \nSHARING \nOrchid Project catalyses the abandonment of \nFGC globally by sharing knowledge between our partners and across the wider movement. We disseminate research and best practice through our Knowledge Sharing Workshops, which bring representatives together to learn and create networks of local organisations working to end FGC. Orchid Project also supports global activists and grassroots partners to attend the Tostan Training Centre in Senegal to understand how change can happen. \n \nADVOCACY \nWe advocate globally to governments and decision makers to ensure that ending FGC is a priority. Orchid Project believes that FGC can only end \nwith the help of stakeholders at every level; from community members, to regional, national and international actors. We make the case for FGC to be represented in frameworks and policies, as it is in the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals, and for work to be fully resourced.", "industry_forums": "", "inter_groups": "Children's rights \nExtreme poverty and human rights", "number_of_persons_involved": "3", "relevant_communication": "- contribution to relevant sessions during EC Seminar for human rights focal points in the EU's Delegations worldwide \n- attending the European Development Days and other events \n- providing topical briefings on FGC for relevant EU stakeholders \n- Orchid Project 2018 digital leaflet available here https://orchidproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Orchid_Project_Leaflet_2018.pdf", "financial_year_end_date": "01/03/2017", "lat": 51.48587060000001, "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "25000-49999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "1080688", "legal_status": "Charity and Company Limited by Guarantee", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Julia Lalla-Maharajh", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "CEO and Founder", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+44)2037525504"}
