At present, our 1054 members are distributed throughout 95 countries globally. We understand that global cooperation and open dialogue between stakeholders are key to identifying and mitigating factors that threaten bee populations worldwide. We work towards our mission by structuring our association around three main themes: 1. Pests & Pathogens, 2. Environmental Stress (e.g. pesticides & nutrition), 3. Breeding & Conservation (e.g. genetic diversity & disease resistance). Within these themes, COLOSS leads Core Projects and runs Tasks Forces, which focus activities on specific, high-priority topics identified by our association, including long-term monitoring of honey bee colony losses.
