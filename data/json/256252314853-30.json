The organisation is funded by contributions of our members that are calculated based on pupils numbers in the member countries. VISION: Education enabling all children to holistically unfold their unique potential throughout their lifelong personal and professional development. MISSION: Supporting genuine Steiner Waldorf education and promoting human-centred education in Europe. PRIORITIES: To implement our mission, we promote freedom in education and school autonomy. The provision of genuine Steiner Waldorf education tailored to local needs is best achieved if the following conditions are met: 1) Freedom of curriculum: National associations and local schools can define and fully implement their own school curricula; 2) The freedom of parental school choice as described in Article 14, Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union is granted Europe wide; 3) Full public funding for independent non-profit schools is granted Europe wide to realize the right of parental school choice, irrespective of financial means; 4) Pluralism in assessment is a reality and Waldorf schools may develop and provide their own, state-recognised diploma. Standardised and centralised tests are replaced with individualised assessment; 5) Age-appropriate ICT and media pedagogy: Our schools can provide their own ICT and media pedagogy based on our development-oriented approach.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+32)26440043"}
