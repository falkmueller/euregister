It meets the fundamental needs of individuals and the family that play a crucial role in creating a more humane society. \n \nA home does not build itself and needs to be well managed. Each member of the family has a pivotal role to play in the organisation of the home that can be learnt from a young age. The home belongs to everyone dwelling within it and is the place where individuals develop their most meaningful environment. \n \nEvery individual needs a high level of care in order to flourish, whether they are children, elderly, adolescents or men and women with demanding and stressful professions. \n \nAs a think tank, HRF\u2019s purpose is to bring about change in our understanding of the professional dimension of the work of the home for a well-balanced society. The Home Renaissance Foundation team works on: \n \nAcademic Research \nInterdisciplinary academic research -theoretical and practical- to produce the relevant knowledge required for this change. Research gives us the tools to raise awareness of the value of the work of the home. We strive to become an authority on knowledge relating to the home, the work of the home and the care of the family. \n \nInspiring Excellence \nInspiring excellence in training and expertise in tasks within the home, our Foundation aims to ensure that our inherited traditions, natural talents and the correct and efficient use of new technologies all contribute toward the creation of well-run homes. \n \nCreating a dialogue for change \nWe want to act as a catalyst for change by encouraging public policies that recognise the new family dynamics and promote education and communication strategies that increase awareness that family tasks are a matter of shared responsibility.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+44)7742432559"}
