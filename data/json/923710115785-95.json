Wherever possible, TPN works with established organisations and institutions, avoiding duplication and enhancing specific objectives. \nTPN does not itself take positions on specific issues nor represent specific interests.", "industry_forums": "", "head_office_phone": "(+32)22306149", "level_of_interest": "European, global", "relevant_communication": "", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2017", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "516433", "legal_status": "Non-profit NGO", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Vivien Haig", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "Director-General"}
