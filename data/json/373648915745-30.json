Not only in Europe, but also in less developed regions. That is, creative industries are also a tool of development. \nWe also assume that technology and new media have created new connections between arts and culture and other players of social and economic life. \nCUMEDIAE and its network of professionals try to be at the center of these changes, and we build, advice or manage cross border projects around them. Among others, we are running the wiki platform Culture Agora, www.cultureagora.info. \nAs a non-profit organization, while we do not work for free, there is no profit or dividend for CUMEDIAE beyond remuneration to its professionals and the cover of expenses.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+32)022580877"}
