In addition, at institutional level UAN is active in associations as AUIP, UDUAL, AUALCPI, IAU, Universia and Association of University Research Parks, among others.  Likewise, the UAN research groups participates in collaborative international research networks in different fields, such as physic, engineering, health, etc. That is how UAN has have a relevant scientific collaboration with leading research European centers such as the CERN. This cooperation has allowed the institution to participate in initiatives such as ATLAS, project related with the discovery of the Higgs Boson. \nRegarding to the mobility of students, UAN offers two reciprocal scholarships schemes, the Colombian-Argentinian Academic Mobility (MACA) and the Brazilian-Colombian Academic Mobility (BRACOL). UAN is also member of the EMUAL and PAME academic exchange programs. These schemes offer reciprocal scholarships in over 200 Latin American universities members. Mobility scholarships are also made available to graduate students and post-doctoral professors by the AUIP.  \nAt this time, UAN is carrying out one of its institutional strategic projects: the Internationalization Laboratory (UAN INT-LAB) with the guidance of the American Council on Education. The UAN INT-LAB is a space for reflection and collective construction and action, from which the UAN is developing a review of the institutional internationalization, its policies, plans and strategies in order to make a qualitative leap in its internationalization and global engagement processes. This is being done under the direction of a group called \u201cLeaders UAN INT-LAB\u201d supported by a task force organized in seven dimensions of the internationalization: (1) Articulated institutional commitment, (2) Administrative leadership, structure and staffing, (3) Curriculum, co-curriculum and learning outcomes, (4) Faculty policies and practices, (5) Student mobility, (6) Collaboration and partnerships, (7) Science, Technology and Innovation.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+571)3384960"}
