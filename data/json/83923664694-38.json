Since 2007 the Brussels Office has advocated for improved legal framework for local authorities and for recognising their role in the European climate and energy policy, as well as for funding opportunities for local authorities for implementing their climate actions. Climate Alliance also coordinates together with other European city networks the Covenant of Mayors and the Mayors Adapt initiatives", "industry_forums": "", "head_office_phone": "(+49)69 7171390", "level_of_interest": "European, national, regional/local", "relevant_communication": "", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2016", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "50000-99999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "3641842", "legal_status": "Non-profit association", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Andrew Deacon", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "Policy Coordinator"}
