The focus of PostNL is on mail, parcels and e-commerce in the Netherlands, as well as Belgium, Germany and Italy. \n \n \nThe choice to focus on these areas is a logical consequence of our activities. The number of goods ordered online is growing all the time, which means we are delivering more and more parcels, in the domestic as well as the international market. Mail, in the form of direct marketing or printed advertising material, is an important catalyst for e-commerce. \n \nPostNL is also increasingly providing direct support for e-commerce; for example by managing the complete logistics process for online retailers.  \n \nWe see ourselves as providing the missing link between the physical and the online world.  \n \nPostNL provides the postal universal service in The Netherlands. The company is 100% privatised. The shares are traded on the Amsterdam stock exchange (AMX).", "belgium_office_city": "Brussel", "head_office_phone": "(+31)622 930 980"}
