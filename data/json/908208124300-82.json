We look for sustainable, long- term solutions to improve the living conditions for farm animals.  \nOur work is based on the following ethical principles: 1) Animals are sentient beings; 2) The rights and dignity of the animals are inviolable 3) There is no distinction between animal species 4) There is no moral justification for suffering. The goal of animal welfare is to raise the status of animals, not reduce the status of human vision.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+49)761 4787 340"}
