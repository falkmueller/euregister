Saving lives and reducing suffering \nii. Maintaining the dignity of affected communities during and in the aftermath of disasters \niii.

In all of our work, we engage in: \n \n1. \u2018On-the-ground\u2019 work. Engaging with communities, we work with governments, civil society partners and also through direct implementation of programmes, particularly in emergencies. Building local capacity remains an important objective of Concern\u2019s work and working in partnership with local institutions is a means of reaching that objective. We will retain a country presence and an effective, grounded connection with extremely poor people. \n \n2. Influencing for policy change. Our mission statement commits us to address the root causes of the poverty of our target group. Focusing on the issues most pertinent to our work, we derive evidence from our operational programmes to persuade, engage and encourage public and political support for the adoption of pro-poor policies and practices we know to be effective.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+353)14177700"}
