The dynamics of these good practices have the intention to promote the adoption of good environmental practices in the citizens, impacting on new consumption trends and on the waste generation, by waste production reduction.  \nTo oriented LIPOR activity to 2020, the conception of a Strategic Plan 2015-2020 plays an important role in the accomplishment of a sustainable management and it aims to establish structured guidelines for waste recovery and treatment. \nLIPOR is contributing to the Sustainable Development Goals connecting with its business strategies. LIPOR involvement is reflected in the implementation of a structured Innovation Process, the compliance of the Quality Management Systems, the development of the Environmental and Interventional Education Program, promoting Waste Prevention Projects, the implementation of LIPOR 3M Strategy and the Biodiversity Strategy.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+351)229770100"}
