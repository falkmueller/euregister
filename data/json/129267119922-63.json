This was followed by a ban on all net fishing in Area VIa in 2008 which added further pressure to fragile island communities. \nSince then the fishermen have met with their counterparts on all of the Irish islands in order to organise as a national organisation. They have taken their campaign to Europe and back home to Dublin in order to highlight the effects of one size fits all legislation has had across the islands of Ireland. IIMRO collaborates with groups from across Europe and Ireland and are working to implement recognition of small offshore islands in the new EU Common Fisheries Policy which came about largely as a result of our work in Europe:  \u201cSmall offshore islands which are dependent on fishing should where appropriate, be especially recognised and supported in order to enable them to survive and prosper in the future.\u201d", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+353)868525011"}
