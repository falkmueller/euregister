Its aim is to contribute to a regulatory environment that encourages innovation and supports a strong and competitive cosmetics industry in Europe. Files followed by Cosmetics Europe relate in particular to the implementation of the Cosmetic Products regulation, regulatory developments on cosmetics ingredients, consumer safety, consumer information, environmental, sustainability, chemical issues and the development and application of new approaches for safety assessment. \n \nIn 2017, Cosmetics Europe contributed to several European Commission public consultations, including in relation to the REACH REFIT evaluation (28/01/2016 to 28/01/2017); on investigating options for reducing releases to the environment of microplastics (26/06/2017 to 16/10/2017); and on the structures of excise duties applied to alcohol and alcoholic beverages (18/04/2017 to 11/07/2017). \n \nMore recently in early 2018, Cosmetics Europe provided inputs to the European Commission (DG TRADE) questionnaire on announced U.S. tariff increase on imports of certain steel and aluminium products and possible EU commercial policy measures in response. \nMore generally, Cosmetics Europe attended numerous events organised by the EU institutions in 2017, such as European Parliament Plenary sessions, Committees meetings, public hearings and workshops, European Commission stakeholders conferences (e.g. the Circular Economy Stakeholders Conference co-organised with the EESC, the Workshop on the Fitness check exercises of European chemical legislation REACH and non-REACH), MEPs sponsored stakeholders events, Permanent Representations to the EU events and conferences, etc. Cosmetics Europe will continue these activities in 2018.  \n \nFor the purpose of its science research, Cosmetics Europe is following very closely the EU Research and Innovation program Horizon 2020 - the biggest EU research program ever with nearly \u20ac80 billion of funding available over 7 years (2014 to 2020). More particularly, Cosmetics Europe is a partner in the Horizon 2020 project EUToxRisk: a 30 million Euro\u2019s integrated European \u2018Flagship\u2019 Programme Driving Mechanism-based Toxicity Testing and Risk Assessment for the 21st century (http://www.eu-toxrisk.eu/). \nFurthermore, Cosmetics Europe continues its journey towards the validation of further alternative methods to animal testing (AAT) with the   Long Range Science Strategy (2016-2020). The objective of the Long Range Science Strategy (LRSS) collaboration and partnership is to finance, steer and promote the successful development of AAT-based test methods and approaches for safety assessment and to facilitate their regulatory acceptance. \n \nAdditionally, Cosmetics Europe is partnering with the European Commission in the wider framework of the European Partnership for Alternative Approaches to Animal Testing (EPAA) - an unprecedented voluntary collaboration between the European Commission, European trade associations, and companies from seven industry sectors. The partners are committed to pooling knowledge and resources to accelerate the development, validation and acceptance of alternative approaches to further the replacement, reduction and refinement (3Rs) of animal use in regulatory testing. \nFinally, Cosmetics Europe works closely with the EU institutions on the elaboration and the adoption of technical standards such as ISO / CEN and on the promotion of international convergence of worldwide cosmetics regulations, in particular through its participation in ICCR (International Cooperation on Cosmetics Regulation). Cosmetics Europe also keeps a close relationship with the European Commission on external trade related issues in connection with the activities of its members. For instance, Cosmetics Europe participates to meetings of the Market Access Advisory Committee (MAAC), hosted by DG TRADE.", "level_of_interest": "European, global", "organisation_name": "Cosmetics Europe", "belgium_office_post_code": "", "number_of_persons_involved": "10", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "John Chave", "section": "II - In-house lobbyists and trade/business/professional associations", "lon": "4.4305791", "source": "", "subsection": "Trade and business associations", "belgium_office_phone": "", "overall_budget_turnover_as_a_range": "", "belgium_office_address": "", "persons_accredited_for_access_to_european_parliament_premises": "Chave#John, GIRARD#Paul, WATSON#Diane Louise, WOUTERS#Maria", "registration_date": "11/05/2009", "estimate_of_costs_absolute_amount": "", "website_address": "http://www.cosmeticseurope.eu/", "commission_expert_groups_and_other_similar_entities_european_commission": "Competent Authorities for Biocidal Products (Regulation (EU) No 528/2012)#E03125#http://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regexpert/index.cfm?do=groupDetail.groupDetail&groupID=3125#Observer#C#Consultation Forum on Access and benefit sharing (ABS)#E03396#http://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regexpert/index.cfm?do=groupDetail.groupDetail&groupID=3396#Member#C#Multi-stakeholder Group on Environmental Claims#E03327#http://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regexpert/index.cfm?do=groupDetail.groupDetail&groupID=3327#Member#C#Working Group on Cosmetic Products#E01302#http://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regexpert/index.cfm?do=groupDetail.groupDetail&groupID=1302#Member#C#WG COS - Sub-group on Definition of Nanomaterial #WG COS - Borderlines#WG COS - Sub-group on Annex I #WG COS - Sub- group on Annex III#WG COS - CPNP meeting on nanomaterials #WG COS - Sub-group on Skin allergens#WG COS - Sub-group Claims#WG COS - CPNP maintenance group meeting", "head_office_post_box": "", "head_office_city": "Brussels", "membership": "- The European Center for Public Affairs \u2013 ECPA \u2013 www.theecpa.eu \n- Federation of European and International Associations established in Belgium \u2013 FAIB \u2013 www.faib.org \n- International Cooperation on Cosmetic Regulation \u2013 ICCR - www.iccrnet.org \n- ISO WG 227 on Cosmetics \u2013 www.iso.org \n- CEN WG on Cosmetics \u2013 www.cen.eu \n- European Partnership for Alternative Approaches to Animal Testing (EPAA) - https://ec.europa.eu/growth/sectors/chemicals/epaa_fr", "head_office_post_code": "1160", "position": "Director General", "financial_year_start_date": "01/01/2017", "head_office_country": "Belgium", "number_of_ep_accredited_persons": "4", "relevant_communication": "Events: \nCosmetics Europe organizes yearly events to promote the industry and provide in-depth scientific and regulatory updates to stakeholders.
