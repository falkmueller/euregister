In several fields (such as kidney, bone marrow and liver transplantation and congenital heart disease surgery) it is the only medical institution in Estonia with specialists at such a high level. \nAs Tartu University Hospital is the only hospital of its kind in Estonia, it plays a substantial role in both the undergraduate and post-graduate lives of students, as well as in the development of the country's medical science. Education and research are undertaken in close collaboration with the Medical Faculty of Tartu University. The Hospital also runs programs of further education for employees of other hospitals and primary care units. The lecturers and researchers in Tartu have a long tradition of collaboration with colleagues from across Europe and elsewhere in the world. \n \nThe hospital's mission is to be recognized as a leader in ensuring the continuity and development of Estonian medicine through high-level integrated medical treatment, training and research. \n \nTartu University Hospital provides inpatient, outpatient and community-based services to patients residing all over Estonia. \n \nTartu University Hospital consists of 17 clinics including 43 inpatient departments with approx. 1000 beds, 8 medical services and 11 non-medical services.
