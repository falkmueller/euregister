We support nonviolent civic initiatives in societies where freedom is denied or under threat and we stand in opposition to ideas and forces that challenge the right of all people to be free. Freedom House amplifies the voices of those fighting for freedom in repressive societies. We work directly with democracy and human rights advocates in their own countries and regions. These reformers include human rights defenders, civil society leaders and members of the media. Freedom House\u2019s programs provide these advocates with resources that include training, expert advice, grants and exchange opportunities. We press the United States, other governments, international institutions and regional bodies to adopt consistent policies that advance human rights and democracy around the world. \n \nThe foundation of Freedom House\u2019s work is its analysis. We evaluate the components of freedom and leverage our analytical work to strengthen our advocacy and action efforts. Freedom House's rigorous research methodology has earned the organization a reputation as the leading source of information on the state of freedom worldwide. \n \nFreedom House's programs support human rights and democracy advocates in their efforts promote open government, defend human rights, strengthen civil society and facilitate the free flow of information and ideas. Freedom House's programs primarily offer assistance by providing information, as well as trainings, and on-site technical advice. Freedom House sometimes also provides financial support. In addition, Freedom House offers symbolic and moral support through advocacy and visible demonstrations of solidarity on behalf of counterparts abroad, which can give them a measure of protection and may enhance their confidence to continue their activities.", "industry_forums": "", "inter_groups": "", "number_of_persons_involved": "1", "relevant_communication": "Freedom House implements international programs and produces annual research surveys on political rights and civil liberties, press freedom, democracy, and internet freedom.", "financial_year_end_date": "01/06/2017", "lat": 38.9053581, "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "0-9999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "26994400", "legal_status": "NGO", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Lisa Dickieson", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "Senior Vice President", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+1)2027477000"}
