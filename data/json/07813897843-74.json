The European Foundry Association was established in 1953. The General Secretariat is situated in D\u00fcsseldorf since 1997. \n \nIt is the statutory mission of CAEF to look into any and all questions that are of importance to the foundry industry, be they economic, technical, legal, or social. At the same time, CAEF implements activities which aim at developing national foundry industries and co-ordinating their shared international interests. \n \nIn other words: CAEF is a universal organisation which covers the entire variety of casting materials, combining the activities of an industry federation and a technical society of foundries. \n \nThe activities of CAEF are twofold in principle: \n \nFirstly, to endorse the interests of the foundry industry towards European and other institutions and authorities. What is more, CAEF is addressed by worldwide partners in all matters relating to the foundry industry of Europe. \n \nSecondly, the activities of CAEF also focus on promoting information exchange among national foundry associations, and on co-ordinating the activities of national associations wherever this appears indicated to benefit the industry as a whole. \n \nAt this stage, CAEF already has its own well-developed institutional structure of co-operation among national foundry associations. That this is indeed so is documented by the existence of numerous commissions, groups, and sections which handle CAEF's practical work.", "industry_forums": "", "head_office_phone": "(+49)2116871217", "level_of_interest": "European", "relevant_communication": "-Summary of national reports of member associations in the NePSi-dialogue \n-Commission of Statistics (formerly Commisson 7)- Report - The European Foundry Industry (annual publication)", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2016", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "0-9999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "0", "legal_status": "association \u00e9trang\u00e8re (French law)", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Max Schumacher", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "Secretary General"}
