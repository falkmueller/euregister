She took up appointment in March 2015. It is NICCY\u2019s role to safeguard and promote the rights and best interests of children and young people.  \n\u2018Children and Young People\u2019 refers to anyone up to the age of 18, or up to 21 if they have a disability, or have experience of the care system. \nWhen promoting the rights of children and young people, we use the UNCRC to guide our work. All of NICCY\u2019s work is focused on making sure children and young people know about, and have access to these rights in their day-to-day lives, so they have the best opportunity to reach their full potential.  \nThe Government and relevant authorities in Northern Ireland (including health, education and justice agencies) provide services for children and young people. One of NICCY\u2019s jobs is to check they do this in a way that is in the best interests of young people. \nWe do this by: \n\u2022    Advising government \u2013 Advising   government and all its agencies on the policies, legislation (laws), and services it provides for children, young people and their families. \n\u2022    Monitoring \u2013 Checking what government does for children and young, to make sure that they do what is best. \n\u2022    Holding government to account \u2013 When NICCY finds out that not enough is being done for children and young people; it challenges government to do better. \nIt is very important that NICCY is aware of, and understands the issues that affect children and young people. It has different ways of finding this out: \n\u2022    Listening to children and young people \u2013 The UNCRC is very clear that children\u2019s views must be heard, and inform decisions which affect their lives. NICCY asks children and young people what they think is important, and what they would like to see changed. The Commissioner has a group of young people (Youth Panel) who help with specific pieces of work. This includes advising on the best ways to communicate with children and young people; \n\u2022    Listening to other adults \u2013 We also listen  to parents, carers, teachers, social workers and other professionals who care for or  work with children and young people;  \n\u2022    Evidence \u2013 NICCY carries out or commissions research, and talks to experts to find out more about the issues that affect children and young people. This allows it to recommend how things can be made better. \nNICCY\u2019s current priority areas of work are: \n\u2022    Tackling Educational inequalities \n\u2022    Child Poverty and advising on welfare reform \n\u2022    Mental Health and Wellbeing \n\u2022    Addressing the legacy of conflict in Northern Ireland \n\u2022    Advising on the impact of \u2018Brexit\u2019 on Children\u2019s Rights", "industry_forums": "", "inter_groups": "", "number_of_persons_involved": "4", "relevant_communication": "Current work on Brexit exploring the impact of Britian's exit from the EU on Children's Rights in the Island of Ireland.  \n \nThe Commissioner has worked with the Ombudsman for Children in Ireland to develop a youth led project on Children's Rights and Brexit.  \n \nA steering group of 20 Young people developed and led a conference involving over 100 young people from the island of Ireland to discuss their hopes and concerns about Brexit.
