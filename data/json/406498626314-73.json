However, there is a dearth of knowledge about, and little understanding of, how regional political changes affect the everyday lives and needs of the region\u2019s people. The world has celebrated the rising stars of the \u201cArab Spring\u201d revolutions and appreciated their contributions to bringing about change, but many others remain unrecognized, their grievances marginalized or ignored. With the support of our deeply knowledgeable and extensive network of actors in the region, TIMEP is committed to having these marginalized voices be acknowledged. The analyses provided by TIMEP will particularly aim to connect those outside the region with local knowledge and perspectives. By harnessing the extensive regional expertise of its staff\u2014along with that of its expansive network of on-the-ground experts and activists\u2014TIMEP will contribute significantly to the national dialogue concerning the Middle East and thereby promote well-founded policy in the region.", "industry_forums": "", "head_office_phone": "(+32)496614375", "level_of_interest": "European", "relevant_communication": "Project on solutions for Libya \nProject on sectarian violence in Egypt \nEvents on democracy in Tunisia \nEvents on human rights in Egypt \nPublications on Al Qaeda \nPublications on the state of Egypt \nPublications on Syria", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2017", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "100000-199999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "235000", "legal_status": "iASBL", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Koert Debeuf", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "Director"}
