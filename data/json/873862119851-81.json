They were united by an ambition to mend relations between European horticulturists, to rebuild burnt bridges. That vision inspired them to form the Association Internationale des Producteurs de l\u2019Horticulture (AIPH), laying the foundations for an international community that exists to this day. \nAIPH is serving the diverse needs of growers in a globalised world. Pushing the boundaries of science and sharing cutting edge research. To make clear the value of plants in the urban setting, and to advance the essential role they play in sustaining our planet.  \nOur mission is: to reignite and uphold an appreciation of plants that we believe is a basic human instinct.
