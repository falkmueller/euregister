It was created in January 2008 through the merger of two previously existing associations, ACME and AISAM. \n \nIts prime purpose is to ensure that the voice of the mutual and cooperative insurance sector in Europe is heard and that the interest of its members are taken into account in securing a level playing field for all insurers in Europe regardless of their legal form. \n \nAMICE provides a platform for mutual and cooperative insurers of all sizes to combine resources and expertise, exchange experiences across national borders and discuss key issues and concerns relating to planned legislative and regulatory changes and developments. \n \nIn the 28 EU Members States, the close to 2,700 insurers united in the mutual and cooperative sector account for more than half of all insurance undertakings and for a market share of over 30% representing close to EUR 400 billion in insurance premiums. They provide cover for close to 400 million members-policyholders and employ 430,000 staff. \n \nWith more than 100 direct members and representing about 700 more insurers indirectly, AMICE speaks for a significant part of the insurance sector.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+32)2 609 56 40"}
