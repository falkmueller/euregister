FIA EPTA is comprised of 28 principal trading firms (PTFs) which deal on own account in a wide range of financial instruments traded on trading venues across Europe. PTFs play a key role in the modern financial ecosystem, bridging gaps in supply and demand between market participants and facilitating price discovery, especially at times when markets are volatile. FIA EPTA members engage in manual,  \nautomated and hybrid methods of trading. Collectively, FIA EPTA members are an important source of liquidity for trading venues and end-investors, allowing those who use the capital markets (whether to invest or to manage their business risks), to buy or sell financial instruments efficiently and at low cost.  \n \nFIA EPTA\u2019s mission is to support transparent, robust and safe markets with a level playing field for all market participants.
