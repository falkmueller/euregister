We do this by connecting and advising key domestic and international influencers on the overall benefits of CCS.  \n \nWe also raise the profile of CCS as a vital, safe and clean energy technology through ongoing media and public awareness campaigns.  \nGreater understanding of the technology advances the development, demonstration, and deployment of CCS and leads to the formation of appropriate incentives, funding, financing and risk solutions.  \n \nKnowledge sharing  \n \nThe Institute generates, collects and shares information, experiences and lessons learnt by connecting people and networks. This enables government and industry to accelerate the uptake of technology, improve public awareness, reduce costs and drive innovation.  \nStrengthening capacity for CCS implementation.  \nThe Institute helps Members to build capability for implementing CCS demonstration across people, technology and policy matters.  \nWe do this by working directly with stakeholders to support the development of appropriate policies and programs, building understanding of financial and commercial issues as they affect projects, and deploying capability development programs.  \n \nAs a result, we are able to make progress on a range of complex challenges that have an impact on the demonstration of CCS.", "level_of_interest": "global", "organisation_name": "Global CCS Institute Ltd (GCCSI)", "belgium_office_post_code": "1050", "number_of_persons_involved": "3", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "John Frederick Scowcroft", "section": "IV - Think tanks, research and academic institutions", "source": "-", "subsection": "Think tanks and research institutions", "belgium_office_phone": "(+32)25503961", "overall_budget_turnover_as_a_range": "", "belgium_office_address": "Place du Champ de Mars 5 Bastion Tower, 20st Floor", "no_geo_reference": true, "persons_accredited_for_access_to_european_parliament_premises": "HEDENCOVA#Sona, SCHNEIDER#Annya, SCOWCROFT#John", "registration_date": "25/08/2014", "estimate_of_costs_absolute_amount": "", "website_address": "http://www.globalccsinstitute.com/", "commission_expert_groups_and_other_similar_entities_european_commission": "NA", "head_office_post_box": "23335", "head_office_city": "Docklands", "membership": "Zero Emission Technology Platform (ZEP), Climate Technology Centre Network (CTCN)", "head_office_post_code": "VIC 3000", "position": "Executive Advisor", "financial_year_start_date": "01/07/2016", "head_office_country": "Australia", "number_of_ep_accredited_persons": "3", "relevant_communication": "* CCS Directive evaluation review  \n* EU Emission Trading Scheme Reform  \n* European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) \n* Energy security and Energy Union dossier", "financial_year_end_date": "01/06/2017", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "400000-499999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "14234500", "legal_status": "Independent, not-for-profit company registered under the (Australian) Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).", "procurement": "0", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "goals__remit": "The Institute accelerates the development, demonstration and deployment of CCS globally through our knowledge sharing activities, fact-based influential advice and advocacy, and work to create favourable conditions to implement CCS. \n \nOur vision for CCS: \nCCS is an integral part of a low-carbon future \n \nOur mission: \nTo accelerate the development, demonstration and deployment of CCS globally \n \nOur objectives \nAuthoritative knowledge sharing \nFact-based influential advice and advocacy \nCreate favourable conditions to implement CCS \n \nOur outcomes \nIncreased public understanding and acceptance of CCS \nIncreased commercial opportunities for CCS \nEqual treatment of CCS with other clean energy technologies in energy and climate change policy", "belgium_office_city": "Bruxelles", "head_office_phone": "(+61)3 8620 7300"}
