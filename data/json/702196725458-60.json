We advocate a model of cooperation that looks for complex, structural and sustainable solutions to problems and inequalities that the current system provokes and that fights for breaking performances that generate more poverty or temporary solutions. We are committed to the dissemination of truthful information, knowledge and experiences on the issues and causes in which we work. Focus on networking, building alliances and participation in European spaces. \nIn Alianza por la Solidaridad, we are convinced that this way of managing the complexity of development is the key to social transformation in an efficient and lasting way: in order to be unstoppable. \n \nOur values and beliefs \n\u2022    We believe in the power of individuals and groups to change the world. When people organize, pool their capabilities and direct their efforts to transform their societies, correcting the deeply rooted inequalities in a sustainable way, they empower and produce changes. \n\u2022    We believe that all people on the planet have to be citizens. We stand with ambition that all human beings have equal value and deserve to enjoy all the universal rights that go beyond geographical boundaries and therefore, must have legal and social capacity in order to demand these rights to the States and the international community. \n\u2022    We believe it is our duty to collaborate with future generations in order to create opportunities to build a new model of life based on justice and equality, as well as respect for the planet and its natural and cultural diversity and richness. \n\u2022    We believe that solidarity is the main moral and political link in which you can create a global society of citizens who respect diversity within a common framework of Human Rights. \n\u2022    We believe that the best role social organizations can play is being catalysts and mediators of partnerships among actors who mobilize resources, knowledge and skills, in order to facilitate the empowerment of citizens and their organizations. \n\u2022    We believe that learning and knowledge are an essential part of social organizations and their role in the service of social change and the empowerment of people is one of our main functions. \n\u2022    We believe that transparency and accountability must structure our organization as much about resources and funds which we manage as about the impact and changes that we generate in our work.", "industry_forums": "", "inter_groups": "", "number_of_persons_involved": "6", "relevant_communication": "EDD 2016 on Business and Human Rights;  previous EDD in 2015 and 2013; consultation on the European Consensus on Development; EU CELAC civil society F\u00f3rum with the presence of the Hight Representative of the EU, video, declaration, comunications and forum organization; Consultation on enabling environment in the MENA regi\u00f3n and report,  EP Hearing on Latin America at DEVE commission; participation on SDG process and dialogue at Country level.
