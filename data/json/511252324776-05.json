The CSC\u2019s objective is to advance purified primary smoke products (\u201cclean smoke\u201d) for the smoking of foods (meat, fish, cheese and other foods) as well as the use of smoke flavourings. Clean smoke is substantially cleaner (environment), healthier (consumer safety), safer (work safety) and more easy to handle (SME-friendliness) and outperforms conventional smoking in all these fields. The same applies to the use of smoke flavourings in food processing. The association is advocating for a better suited regulatory framework for clean smoke currently still suffering from misconceptions on the side of consumers and regulators. \n \nThe CSC works towards: \n-    a EU regulatory framework better adapted to state-of-the-art smoke technologies  \n-    clear and truthful consumer information on CleanSmoke \n-    recognition of CleanSmoke as the preferred option for the smoking of food in small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs)  \n-    recognition of CleanSmoke as a contribution to the protection of the environment, human health and work safety  \n-    a secured position of CleanSmoke in the production of organic food", "industry_forums": "", "head_office_phone": "(+32)027396262", "level_of_interest": "European, global, national", "relevant_communication": "Clean Smoke Congress 27/3/2017 \nClean Smoke Congress 17/10/2017", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2016", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "10000-24999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "0", "legal_status": "non-for-profit corporation (Association internationale sans but lucrative \u2013 AISBL) under Belgian law in formation", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Jens  Karsten", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "Secretary"}
