As the leading think tank in Germany for IT law, DGRI addresses issues that lie at the interface between informatics and computer technology on the one hand, and the law and business, on the other hand. The objective of DGRI is to promote the interaction between academia, research and practice in the following areas: \n \n    * Legal issues relating to the processing of information; \n    * The use of information technology within the legal system; and \n    * Shaping the legal framework conditions for information technology. \n \nWithin its area of interest DGRI has been addressing for more than 30 years both academics and practitioners, seeking an exchange of knowledge, experiences and views. The information thus obtained is placed at the disposal of the DGRI members and other interested parties, and is also utilized in order to promote the legislative process and the quality of judicial decisions insofar as possible and appropriate. \n \nIn order to fulfill these objectives DGRI has established Expert Committees where experts and interested parties regularly exchange their views on present issues within the area of the Association\u2019s interest, in addition to developing and organizing both internal and public events. The Association also organizes public congresses, conferences, workshops and other events devoted to current themes within its area of interest.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+49721)78202729"}
