We inform our members about and involve them in policy developments at the EU level, with particular attention to EU 2020, ET2020, the European Agenda for adult learning, the European Education Area and Upskilling Pathways and the European Semester.  \nIn reverse, we also inform the European (and national) level how our members perceive the implementation of these policies at their level (national / regional / local). When possible, we will provide tools to empower our members to engage at their respective levels as well. \nAnother key aspect of our work is involving our members and other AE providers in cross-sectorial, cross-national and cross-organisational peer learning and exchange of know-how and practice. This will lead to strengthening adult learning and education in Europe and enable more people in Europe to participate, especially people with low basic skills and people from disadvantaged groups.  \nIn terms of cooperation, we will continue our work with the European institutions as a critical friend and with our civil society platforms to boost our exchange of expertise and influence. Starting from 2018 EAEA will also broaden its cooperations in order to become even more effective. For the next three years, we want to strengthen our collaboration with social partners, other sectors and more EU institutions (i.e. the Committee of the Regions). This will help us be more effective and have more impact in the world of work and at the regional level. We also plan to cooperate more with research to reinforce our evidence base.", "level_of_interest": "European", "organisation_name": "European Association for the Education of Adults (EAEA)", "belgium_office_post_code": "", "number_of_persons_involved": "5", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Regina Ebner", "section": "III - Non-governmental organisations", "lon": "4.3694425", "source": "", "subsection": "Non-governmental organisations, platforms and networks and similar", "belgium_office_phone": "", "overall_budget_turnover_as_a_range": "", "belgium_office_address": "", "persons_accredited_for_access_to_european_parliament_premises": "EBNER#Regina, KIHRER#Raffaela, OPERTI#Francesca", "registration_date": "26/11/2008", "estimate_of_costs_absolute_amount": "280000", "website_address": "http://www.eaea.org", "commission_expert_groups_and_other_similar_entities_european_commission": "ET 2020 Working Group on Adult Learning#E02995#http://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regexpert/index.cfm?do=groupDetail.groupDetail&groupID=2995#Member#C#ET2020 Working Group on Promoting citizenship and the common values of freedom, tolerance and non-discrimination through education #E03371#http://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regexpert/index.cfm?do=groupDetail.groupDetail&groupID=3371#Member#C", "head_office_post_box": "", "head_office_city": "Brussels", "membership": "EAEA is a member of the Social Platform, ICAE (International Council for Adult Education), Lifelong Learning Platform, CONCORD, European Movement, UNESCO Liaison Committee and Council of Europe", "head_office_post_code": "1000", "position": "Secretary General", "financial_year_start_date": "01/01/2016", "head_office_country": "Belgium", "number_of_ep_accredited_persons": "3", "relevant_communication": "EAEA\u2019s longer-term objectives are increasing participation in adult education, esp. by raising awareness for the wider benefits of learning; Promoting excellence and effectiveness in policy making and policy implementation through civil society proposals; New methods for engaging new learners and innovation through co-operations, new methodologies and international work. \n \nThe following activities are planned:  \n1.
