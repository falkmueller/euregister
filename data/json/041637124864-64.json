This action is designed to strengthen the collective capacities of the CSOs in their role as stakeholders in national development; building on the strategic and comparative advantages of each CSO\u2019s thematic area while emphasizing multi-stakeholder partnerships to increase the impact of individual results into collective developmental results. While acknowledging that CSOs in Zimbabwe are well organised if compared to other 4 in the region and on the continent, the project partners realise that their actions however remain disjointed; local CSOs still suffer from lack of coordination in terms of programmatic activities and at times compete for the same space rather than fostering collaboration leading to duplication and wastage of resources. The action supports the realisation of the 2014-2017 EU CSO Roadmap for Engagement and in particular notes the need to increase communication and interaction amongst CSOs through strengthening existing information sharing platforms and supporting innovative social media spaces. \nAt the Global Level \nEnhancing Civil Society Role in Development Partnerships Post 2015 \u2013 Main applicant is IBON International on behalf of CSO Partnership for Development Effectiveness (CPDE), NAYO is co-applicant in the action on behalf of the CPDE Youth Sector.
