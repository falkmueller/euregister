Until 2009, FD has published Fuoriluogo, distributed as a monthly supplement to the national daily paper il Manifesto (where it still publishes a weekly opinion editorial). Fuoriluogo, which is now available on line (www.fuoriluogo.it), deals specifically with drug policies, justice and law enforcement at both national and international level. One of its main objectives is producing information on the most innovative drug policies carried out in European countries. Fuoriluogo.it provides reliable and up to date information and documentation on a wide variety of issues (drug legislation, imprisonment of addicts and therapeutic alternatives to incarceration, cannabis decriminalization, cannabis and science, harm reduction practices, medical cannabis etc.). FD also publishes \u201cI Quaderni di Fuoriluogo\u201d, a series of thematic papers.  \nFD has sponsored or co-sponsored many conferences, seminars and training courses for drug professionals all over Italy, mostly on harm reduction approach, low threshold services, patterns of drug use in natural settings, drug policy reform issues, international and European drug policies. \nOne of the last (in terms of time) achievement due to Forum Droghe activity is the reform of Italian drug national policy, in terms of decriminalization of personal drug possession. Forum Droghe played a leading role in the already mentioned 2013-2014 campaign \u201cDrugs, prisons and human rights\u201d ; FD is also conducting the present campaign \u201cFor the reform of Italian Drug legislation and for prisoners\u2019 rights\u201d in the advocacy work for the reform of drug legislation. \nIn 2012, Forum Droghe has promoted a coalition of NGOs working in drug policies, justice and human rights advocating a shift towards a less punitive drug legislation, more respectful of drug users\u2019 human rights,  so as  to tackle prisons overcrowding, largely due to the high number of incarcerated drug offenders .  \nIn addition to the advocacy mission, Forum droghe has also been promoting research in the following fields:  \n-    evaluation of the drug legislation on its impact on the prison and justice systems, by publishing the First (2009), Second (2011) ,Third  (2012) Fourth (2013), Fifth (2014) and Sixth (2015) White Book on the 2006 drug legislation and its implementation: http://ungass2016.fuoriluogo.it/2015/11/18/seconda-edizione-del-6-libro-bianco-sulla-legge-sulle-droghe/ ; see in English: http://idpc.net/publications/2014/09/fifth-white-book-on-the-2006-italian-drug-legislation-and-its-consequences-on-the-penal-and-prison-systems  \n-    studies about \u201ccontrols\u201d over drug use (cocaine in particular) and users\u2019 perception of controlled/uncontrolled use, carried out in natural settings. development of an innovative prevention approach in drug use within the Harm Reduction model (the so called self regulation model of intervention),  carried out in 2013 through the European project \u201cNew Approaches in Drug Policy and Interventions\u201d (with the financial support of the Drug Prevention and Information Programme of the European Union\u201d).", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2017", "lat": "43.7637141", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "43921", "legal_status": "non profit association", "procurement": "", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "goals__remit": "Forum Droghe is a non profit organization, founded in 1995, to promote a public health approach to drug policies and reduce the unintended consequences of punitive drug legislations on the justice and prison systems.

The site (www.fuoriluogo.it), deals specifically with drug policies, justice and prison policies, Harm Reduction policies and interventions and other social issues, at both national and international level.  \nSince the 2000s, Forum Droghe has also developed research activities, in the field of both the evaluation of drug legislation and in patterns of drug use, in the effort of linking evidence from studies in natural settings to models of intervention in drug services. Training courses addressed to drug addiction professionals are also organized, to promote the most innovative models in Harm Reduction interventions.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+39)0556587433"}
