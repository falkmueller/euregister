Wim Wenders was elected as first chairman of the association which two years later was renamed European Film Academy. In 1996, he followed Ingmar Bergman as president of the EFA. Current chairwoman is Polish director Agnieszka Holland. \nThe European Film Academy (EFA) unites more than 3,000 European film professionals with the common aim of promoting European film culture. Throughout the year, the EFA initiates and participates in a series of activities dealing with film politics as well as economic, artistic, and training aspects. The programme includes conferences, seminars and workshops, and a common goal is to build a bridge between creativity and the industry. These activities culminate in the annual presentation of the European Film Awards. \nSince its early beginnings, Berlin has been the seat of the EFA Secretariat where it is registered as a non-profit association.", "industry_forums": "", "inter_groups": "", "number_of_persons_involved": "4", "relevant_communication": "The European Film Awards are a Europe-wide and international promotional platform annually highlighting 80 to 90 European film productions (feature, documentary, animation, short films) as well as the film professionals involved in their creation, production and distrubition, with the aim to make the films travel, connect European filmmakers across borders to ease pan-European networking, and to build an international audience, thus improving access to markets, especially outside a film's country of origin.
