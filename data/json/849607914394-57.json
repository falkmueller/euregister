Rowling that works to end the systematic institutionalisation of children around the world. Worldwide eight million children are living in orphanages or other form of institutional care, where their needs cannot be met and where they are at risk of severe harm, abuse and neglect.  \n \nOur vision is a world in which all children have the opportunity to grow up in a safe and caring family setting, or where there is no alternative, the specialist placements that meet all their needs, respect their rights and ensure they can fulfil their potential. We work to transform education, health and social care systems for children and their families and help children move from institutions to family-based care.  \n \nLumos works in partnership with governments, professionals and carers, communities, families and children, to transform outdated systems that drive families apart. Together with our partners we replace institutions with community based services that provide children with access to health, education and social care tailored to their individual needs. This supports families to provide the loving care their children need to develop to their full potential and build a positive future for themselves. Lumos is a founder member of the European Expert Group on the Transition from Institutional to Community Based Care.
