AlgorithmWatch believes that complexity must not mean incomprehensibility (read our ADM manifesto). \n \nAlgorithmWatch is a non-profit research and advocacy organisation to evaluate and shed light on algorithmic decision making processes that have a social relevance, meaning they are used either to predict or prescribe human action or to make decisions automatically. \n \nHOW DO WE WORK? \n \nWatch \nAlgorithmWatch analyses the effects of algorithmic decision making processes on human behaviour and points out ethical conflicts. \n \nExplain \nAlgorithmWatch explains the characteristics and effects of complex algorithmic decision making processes to a general public. \n \nNetwork \nAlgorithmWatch is a platform linking experts from different cultures and disciplines focused on the study of algorithmic decision making processes and their social impact. \n \nEngage \nIn order to maximise the benefits of algorithmic decision making processes for society, AlgorithmWatch assists in developing ideas and strategies to achieve intelligibility of these processes \u2013 with a mix of technologies, regulation, and suitable oversight institutions.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+49)3095998100"}
