The ECPU seeks to inform European decision-makers and provide forums for exchange, thereby forging greater coherence in European China policy in the intermediate term and contributing to a stronger European foreign policy. Europe will have to develop new channels to coordinate and cooperate with China. Specifically, decisions and developments in areas such as trade and investment policy could fundamentally change Sino-European relations. \n \nTo this end, the ECPU analyzes the bilateral as well as multilateral China policies of EU member states and the European institutions, develops formats for exchange and deliberation, and creates new impulses among European partners.", "organisation_name": "Mercator Institute for China Studies (MERICS)", "belgium_office_post_code": "", "number_of_persons_involved": "5", "procurement": "", "section": "IV - Think tanks, research and academic institutions", "source": "", "belgium_office_address": "", "subsection": "Think tanks and research institutions", "belgium_office_phone": "", "number_of_ep_accredited_persons": "", "overall_budget_turnover_as_a_range": "", "belgium_office_city": "", "persons_accredited_for_access_to_european_parliament_premises": "", "estimate_of_costs_absolute_amount": "", "registration_date": "19/03/2018", "website_address": "http://www.merics.de", "commission_expert_groups_and_other_similar_entities_european_commission": "NA", "head_office_post_box": "", "head_office_city": "Berlin", "membership": "we are not members of any association", "head_office_post_code": "10179", "goals__remit": "The Mercator Institute for China Studies (MERICS) is a Stiftung Mercator initiative.
