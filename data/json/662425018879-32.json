The working group EP&R has conducted a one-year investigation of off-site EP&R to present current challenges with regard to nuclear safety from the civil society point of view. This report has been presented on 15 April 2015 in the European Parliament in the presence of MEP Klaus Buchner, Ana Gomes, Jo Leinen, Mich\u00e8le Rivasi and Julie Ward. \n \nStarted a radioactive waste management (RWM) working group, led by Johan Swahn, Director of the Swedish NGO MKG and member of the Management Board of NTW.This working group is the opportunity to create a high-level network of civil society representatives and independent experts that work on RWM issues. The RWM working group interacts both on a European, national, regional and local levels. One of the first projects developed within the NTW RWM working group is a project on improving transparency \u2013 public information and participation \u2013 named the BEPPER project. The aim of the project is to describe, from the perspectives of environmental NGOs, an effective transparency and public participation regimes in the area of spent fuel and radioactive waste management. The long-term aim of the BEPPER project is facilitate the engagement of well-resourced and enduring local, national and international environmental NGOs in Transparency (public information and participation) processes. Such engagement could achieve higher-quality decision-making and increased nuclear safety in RWM.  \n \nStarted to work on other topics including decommissionning, life-time extension, security of nuclear installations, abd ageing of nuclear reactors. For exemple NTW held a seminar on this latest issue in the European Parliament in March 2014. According to its engagement for the application of the Aarhus convention NTW created through this seminar an open discussion with members of the European Parliament, regulators and members of the civil society, in order to increase the transparency of the reflections already taking place. \n \nSet up an Aarhus hotline \u201cAccess to Information\u201d on its website. This hotline aims to provide the support of NTW to the requests made by members of the network to the European institutions and / or to the States concerned, regarding the access to information on decisions affecting the environment and health in the nuclear field.", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2016", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "50000-99999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "51000", "legal_status": "European Association under French law (law as of 1st July 1901, and decree as of 16 August 1901)", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Linda Delory", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "Head of Office"}
