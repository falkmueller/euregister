RAIN RFID is a committee of AIM global and is an alliance promoting the universal adoption of UHF RFID Technology in a way similar to other wireless technology organizations including NFC Forum, WiFi Alliance and Bluetooth SIG. RAIN uses the GS1 UHF Gen 2 protocol which is ISO/IEC has standardized as 18000-63. The word RAIN - an acronym derived from Radio frequency IdentificatioN \u2013 is intended as a nod to the link between UHF RFID and the cloud, where RFID-based data can be stored, managed and shared via the internet.
