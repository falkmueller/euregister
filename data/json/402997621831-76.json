Building on this unique legacy, the Institute will continue to find imaginative ways to tackle the challenges facing the UK and the global community by collaborating with people, organisations and governments to deliver practical solutions for our shared future.  \n \nThe Hutton is one of the world\u2019s leading scientific organisations undertaking research focused on land, crops, water and the environment. The Hutton brings together a broad range of science disciplines that interconnect to deliver our research strategy of finding solutions to the global challenges of providing food, energy and water from finite land and natural resources under changing environmental conditions. To support our research the Institute has a correspondingly broad portfolio of research funding. Our mixed funding portfolio reflects both the scientific excellence and relevance of the Institute\u2019s research encompassing government policy, fundamental and translational research. Funders include the Scottish Government's Rural and Environmental Science and Analytical Services Division, RCUK, TSB, the EU, industry and the UK and foreign governments. The Hutton comprises world class scientists leading in the land, crop, food, water, environmental and socio-economic sciences working in concert.  As a consequence the Hutton has significant international reach which encompasses all global continents, with, for example, environmental research in the Antarctic, crop research in the Americas, Australasia, Africa and Europe, climate change risk modelling across the globe and coast and catchment research across Europe.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+44)844 928 5428"}
