Operating from our sites in Lommel or Leuven, and from 10 research facilities at the Flemish universities, we stimulate open innovation through excellent research.  \n \nOur purpose: realising a top-level research network in Flanders that delivers full support to the innovation projects of manufacturing companies. This way, we want to contribute to new products and processes that help to realise the vehicles, machines and factories of the future. \nAll our research has one purpose: strengthening the product and process innovation within Flemish manufacturing companies so that this industry is better armed and able to cope today with the challenges of tomorrow. To this end, we conduct technological research in the field of mechatronics, product development methods and production technologies. \n \nIn a first phase, this research will lead to actual applications in machines, vehicles and high-tech production systems for the participating companies. In a second phase, research results will also be shared with the rest of the industry.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+32)11790560"}
