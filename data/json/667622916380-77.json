Il Telefono Azzurro ONLUS is a non-profit organisation founded on June 1987 to promote and protect children\u2019s rights. Over the last 30 years, Telefono Azzurro has grown to become a state-wide point of reference for children and adolescents in distress or in situations of risk. We are deeply committed to advocating for children\u2019s rights, as well as promoting a child-centred culture on a transnational scale. To achieve these goals, we work closely with local, national and international institutions and organisations. Telefono Azzurro can rely on a dedicated and qualified team of experts from a variety of fields, such as psychologists, psychiatrists and social assistants, as well as attorneys and law analysts working in our branch offices. \n \nOur core action is our telephone counselling service. Our national toll-free helpline is available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year to listen and help children and adolescents in need. In February 2003, Telefono Azzurro was entrusted to manage the pilot phase of the 114 Childhood Emergency Hotline, resulting from of an agreement between the Ministers for Communication, Equal Opportunities, Work and Social Policies. Furthermore, after signing the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Ministry of the Interior in May 2009, Telefono Azzurro has been also managing the 116 000 hotline for missing children. We also promote on-the-ground initiatives, such as the Emergency Team programme: set up as a pilot project in Treviso, the Emergency Team relies on the action of trained professionals and social service agencies, involved 24 hours a day, 365 days a year in situations where children suffer or witness abuse, may it be domestic violence, prostitution, or delinquency. \n \nTelefono Azzurro has also been implementing school workshops and awareness-raising campaigns to prevent and fight bullying and cyberbullying. We promote a holistic approach, that actively involves students (trough peer-to-peer education) teachers and families, and relies on the support of a specialized staff of psychologist and educators. Our training courses are tailored for students, teachers, and parents, and focus on effective actions to identify and prevent bullying. Students of primary and secondary schools \u2013 bullies, victims and bystanders \u2013 are targeted with a wide array of training in social skills and are helped to increase their self-disclosure and empathy skills. The main objective is to create a school-wide environment that recognises, discourages and effectively responds to bullying. We are engaged in developing epidemiological surveys on bullying and cyberbullying, and interviewing nationally representative samples of school students.  The statistics and data provided by the helpline 196 96 also contribute to give an overview and a deep understanding of bullying and cyberbullying in Italy.", "industry_forums": "", "head_office_phone": "(+39)02550271", "level_of_interest": "European, national, regional/local", "relevant_communication": "Below, we list a selection of EU projects and initiatives that are currently being implemented by SOS Il Telefono Azzurro Onlus: \n \n\u2022 \u201cSafeguarding Unaccompanied Migrant Children by reinforcing the integration of the 116 000 hotline for Missing Children within the Italian Child Protection System\u201d: the general objective of this EU project is to strengthen the protection of Unaccompanied Migrant Children (UMMs). To fulfil this goal, two key actions have been carried out:  \n1) A network of relevant stakeholders for preventing and responding to the disappearance of UMMs has been created and strengthened within 5 Prefectures \u2013 territorial offices of the Government, strengthening the integration of the Italian hotline among them;  \n2) Hotline professionals have been trained on specific issues and can now support the capacity building process of relevant stakeholders identified as key actors for preventing and responding to UMMs disappearances within 5 Prefectures in Italy.  \n \n\u2022 \u201cDeveloping a Client Relationship Management (CRM) Solution for 116 000 hotlines to ensure efficient and harmonized case management and data collection for missing children across the EU\u201d: The project involves the development of a Client Relationship Management (CRM) tool that will allow all 116 000 hotlines to record data related to missing children consistently in the same way. There are 5 pilot countries involved in the project currently including Croatia, France, Italy, Poland and Portugal. The tool is currently in the process of being rolled out and was conceived with the input of a number of 116 000 hotlines that actively participated in the project to ensure that the CRM tool will eventually meet all the needs of the case managers and call operators. Telefono Azzurro, as the body in charge of managing the 116 000 hotline in Italy, is the only Italian partner of this EU initiative, co-funded by DG Justice through the Daphne III programme.  \n \n\u2022 SUMMIT project - Safeguarding Unaccompanied Migrant Minors from going Missing by Identifying Best Practices and Training Actors on Interagency Cooperation.
