The roots of the paritarianism go back to the 19th century but until 20 years ago, the incentives to develop a pan-European paritarian framework have not been conclusive. In the field of social protection, paritarian institutions are non-profit bodies, jointly managed by social partners. The governance of the paritarian institutions is based on the equal representation of both employers and employees.  \nParitarian institutions manage social protection funds set up through collective agreements at the company, the industry-wide or the inter-sectoral level and they can provide a series of social benefits like pensions, health insurances, paid holidays, unemployment and disability.  \nThe combined funds managed by the paritarian institutions across Europe raise up to 1.3 trillion euro in assets and cover about 80 million people.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+32)22335420"}
