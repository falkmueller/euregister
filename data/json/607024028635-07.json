However, without the confidence of the traveler, the aviation sector will be unable to reach its full potential. For this reason, it is APRA\u2019s mission to ensure maximum protection for air passengers by actively engaging in a constructive dialogue with the European and national institutions, as well as airlines, airports, National Enforcement Bodies, and other key stakeholders. \n \nWe offer a combination of solid data, in-depth analysis and our collective expertise, to inform policy makers and promote the interest of European air passengers.", "industry_forums": "", "head_office_phone": "(+32)474882105", "level_of_interest": "European", "relevant_communication": "", "financial_year_end_date": "", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "0", "legal_status": "AISBL", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Patrick  Gibbels", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "Secretary General"}
