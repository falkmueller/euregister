To do this, we identify projects with especially strong potential to bring about social change. We start with a quality assessment process that we developed with experts in the field, identifying sectors to focus on and closely scrutinizing relevant non-profit organisations and their projects. When we find an approach that we feel is especially promising, we award it with the PHINEO impact-label. \n \nAs a not-for-profit corporation, PHINEO is supported by a broad alliance of business and civil society organisations.
