As a leading European supply chain management research center, ZLC is a laboratory where academia and industry collaborate in order to provide people, organizations and societies with the innovative solutions they need. \n  \nOur network includes local, national and international bodies and organizations that cooperate in finding common solutions to today\u2019s and tomorrow\u2019s supply chain challenges. \n \n- The Global SCALE (Supply Chain and Logistics Excellence) Network was initially formed in 2004 with the opening of the Zaragoza Logistics Center (ZLC) in Zaragoza Spain. The MIT Global Supply Chain and Logistics Excellence (SCALE) Network is an international \nalliance of leading-edge research and education \ncenters, dedicated to the development and \ndissemination of global innovation in supply chain \nand logistics. It is designed and operated as a balanced network where each center contributes resources to conduct joint research, administers educational programs, and works with corporate sponsors. \nList of MIT SCALE Centers: \nMIT Center for Transportation & Logistics (CTL), Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA \nZaragoza Logistics Center (ZLC), Zaragoza, Spain \nCenter for Latin-American Logistics Innovation \n(CLI), Bogot\u00e1, Colombia \nMalaysia Institute for Supply Chain Innovation \n(MISI), Shah Alam, Malaysia \nLuxembourg Centre for Logistics (LCL), Luxembourg \nNingbo Supply Chain Innovation Institute China \n(NSCIIC), China \nMIT Global SCALE Network website: \nhttp://scale.mit.edu \n \n- The MIT-Zaragoza International Logistics Program is a unique research and education partnership that brings together the supply chain interests of academia, industry and government - all linked to the development of the largest logistics park in Europe.  \n \nThe program was established in 2003 by the MIT Center for Transportation and Logistics (CTL), the University of Zaragoza (Spain), the Government of Aragon, industry partners, and the PLAZA logistics park in Zaragoza, Spain.  \n \nThe education program offers a masters degree modeled on MIT Supply Chain Management Program (SCM), a doctorate degree, and executive education courses leading to certificates in various logistics-related disciplines.  \n \nThe research program uses the logistics park as a working laboratory to experiment with new logistics processes, concepts and technologies, in active collaboration with leading academic institutions and companies from around the world.  \n  \n- The National Integrated Logistics Competence Center (CNC-LOGISTICA), is a networked center whose mission is to contribute to improving business competitiveness and generate knowledge in the field of integrated logistics. CNC-LOGISTICA was recognized as a National Competence Center by the Spanish Ministry of Education and Science through a Framework Constitution Agreement signed in 2006.  \n \n- The Technology Platform in Logistics, Intermodality and Mobility, Logistop, was constituted as an intersectoral and multidisciplinary working forum, which is open to the participation and incorporation of all stakeholders with interests in the field of integrated logistics, intermodality, transport and mobility. It is configured as a tool to serve its members which conducts and fosters activities to stimulate, mobilize and articulate the critical mass of innovation needed and to align public and private strategies in R+D+i, to generate knowledge and highlight it in order to ensure the competitiveness and sustainability of the logistics, intermodality and mobility (goods and people) businesses in Spain. Therefore, it brings together companies, technology centers, universities and other research bodies. \n \n- Regional cluster of logistics and transportation (ALIA) that involves numerous SMEs and larger companies from the Region of Arag\u00f3n. \n \n- The European Technology Platform in Logistics, ALICE.", "head_office_post_code": "50197", "goals__remit": "Zaragoza Logistics Center (ZLC) is a research institute established by the Government of Aragon in Spain in partnership with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Zaragoza. Founded in 2003, the ZLC campus is located in the heart of PLAZA, the largest logistics park in the southwest of Europe that serves as a working laboratory to transfer new knowledge and working practices. ZLC mission is to create an international center of excellence for research and education in logistics and SCM that actively engages with industry and the public sector to develop and disseminate knowledge. To accomplish its mission ZLC partnered with the MIT Center for Transportation and Logistics to form the MIT-Zaragoza International Logistics Program, a unique model of collaboration between industry, government and academia. This successful partnership led to the creation of the MIT Global SCALE Network that now spans four continents. In addition, Zaragoza Logistics Center participates in several national and international research and educational initiatives. In 2008 the Spanish Ministry of Education and Science officially recognized ZLC as a Knowledge Transfer Office (KTO) after ZLC was previously designated the National Center of Excellence for research in the area of logistics and supply chain management, CNC LOGISTICA, in 2006. This latest recognition puts ZLC in a leading role to define and coordinate research, development and innovation initiatives across Spain in logistics and supply chain management. ZLC offers graduate and executive education in logistics and supply chain management. A diverse group of students from around the world study at the ZLC on the path to positions in leading companies and universities. Programs include: -MIT-Zaragoza Master in Logistics and Supply Chain Management (ZLOG): a nine-month, full-time degree program taught in English. - Master en Direccion de Supply Chain (MDSC): one academic year, part-time degree program taught in Spanish. - Blended SCM Master's Program: allow learners to combine the MITx MicroMasters credential with one+ semester at Zaragoza Logistics Center in Zaragoza, Spain (and which will also include 3 week stay at MIT). - 3C - MIT-Zaragoza-Ningbo Master of Engineering in Logistics and Supply Chain Management: was jointly established by three centers within the MIT Global SCALE Network: MIT Center for Transportation and Logistics (MIT CTL), Zaragoza Logistics Center, and Ningbo Supply Chain Innovation Institute China. - MIT-Zaragoza PhD in Logistics and Supply Chain Management: an internationally recognized doctoral program that enables students to spend time at MIT as visiting students. - Executive Education: both open-enrollment and customized short courses designed for senior managers. - MIT-Zaragoza PhD Summer Academy: intense period of learning, debating, and discovering the fundamental concepts and recent trends in supply chain management. The MIT-Zaragoza International Logistics Program brings leading faculty, graduate students, and research staff together with prominent global companies and organizations to engage in cutting edge research. The program serves as a model for closer cooperation between industry and academia in funding research and using the fruit of the academic research to rapidly reap commercial benefits. Faculty from Zaragoza Logistics Center, the MIT Center for Transportation & Logistics, and other leading universities actively participate in the research efforts. Faculty and companies work together to identify relevant and challenging problems. Faculty members also lead the efforts of graduate students working on doctoral dissertations and masters' thesis projects. Such collaboration provides excellent context for student research and direct benefit to the participating companies.", "industry_forums": "", "head_office_phone": "(+34)976077600", "level_of_interest": "European, global, national, regional/local", "relevant_communication": "Expertise and examples of recent projects relevant to the Transparency Register: \n\u2022 NEXT-NET - Next generation Technologies for networked Europe.
