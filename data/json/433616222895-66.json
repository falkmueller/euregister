The GRC is a member of the Federal Working \nGroup of Voluntary Welfare Organisations (BAGFW)*1. \nThis group comprises six of the largest German welfare \norganisations, representing more than 90,000 social and \nwelfare services, with more than 1.3 million employees. \n \nThe German Red Cross has a federal structure that \nincludes: \n19 regional branches 500 district branches \n4.500 local branches \n31 nurses\u2018 associations  \n1 federation of nurses\u2018 associations \n> 10,000 community and technical committees \n6 blood transfusion Centers with \n1.7 Mio blood donators \n \nVarious GRC activities are implemented by the  \n410,000 volunteers and the more than 158,000 fulltime \nstaff. More than 3 Mio GRC members support their \norganisation financially or in non-material ways. \nThe General Secretariat (further called headquarter) in Berlin represents the German Red Cross in all its activities on national and international Levels. It is as well responsible for all of the National Society\u2018s activities abroad.  \nRegional or local GRC branches may also run activities in other countries but must coordinate these with national headquarter in Berlin and the partner National Society. \nIn emergency, rehabilitation or development cooperation, the GRC coordinates with other components of the Red Cross Red Crescent Movement. In the majority of cases, the GRC cooperates with a Red Cross or Red Crescent partner National Society on a bilateral basis. Red Cross consortia of several National Societies and multilateral cooperation even with organisations outside the Movement also occur, but less frequently. \n \nEvery GRC intervention abroad presupposes a request \nof the National Society in the country concerned. GRC \nactivities are always based on its own strategy and the strategic planning of the partner and pursue two aims: \n\u2022 Support the most vulnerable people in the \npartner countries in order to improve their living \nconditions and contribute to sustainable local \ndevelopment and resilience of the population. \n\u2022 Support the partner National Societies in their \norganisational development and capacity building \nwith regard to their services for the vulnerable. This \ncontributes to the strengthening of the civil Society in the Partner country. \nThe GRC works in more than 50 countries worldwide. \nThe main focus of activities is on: \n\u2022 Emergency response and disaster management \n\u2022 Rehabilitation and reconstruction \n\u2022 Development of key sectors: Disaster risk reduction \nand adaptation to climate change; health; \nwater and sanitation and livelihood programmes.  \n \nThe concepts of strengthening Resilience of the most vulnerable and better linking relief, rehabilitation and development play a vital role in international GRC cooperation.", "industry_forums": "", "inter_groups": "", "number_of_persons_involved": "5", "relevant_communication": "None", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2017", "lat": 52.4300513, "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "200000-299999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "108768856", "legal_status": "Eingetragener Verein", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Silvia Sanz-Ramos", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "Referentin Zuwendungsgeber", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+49)854040"}
