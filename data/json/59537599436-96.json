The creation of NLA is also a step to engage in a stronger dialogue and cooperation with land transport organisations from other countries in the rest of the EU. This will give the EU an opportunity to get better background information and assessment in the context of legislating in the EU. NLA will also continue the constructive and important cooperation that the three founding associations have had with the International Road Transport Union (IRU) in Bruxelles.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+32)495912308"}
