People all around the world are feeling the effects. \n \nNature is the natural resource base on which all humans depend. Species and habitat diversity are prerequisites of a quality environment. Our aim is a European continent that hosts free-flowing rivers, pristine forests, diverse cultural landscapes as well as sufficient space for wild animals and migrating birds within these and other ecosystems.  \n \nWe are committed to connecting people and nature in a peaceful Europe \u2013 beyond national borders. Our efforts for the protection of plants, animals and habitats are transboundary in nature; we strengthen local conservation organizations and create international networks between them. Together with our Europe-wide partner network we create solutions that allow humans to live and work in harmony with nature.", "industry_forums": "", "head_office_phone": "(+49)773292720", "level_of_interest": "European", "relevant_communication": "Chair of European Green Belt Association (Pan-European Conferences, www.greenbelt.org, brochure);  \nMember of the European Habitat Forum; \nCoordination of Alliance of associations for a new agricultural policy (position papers); \nwww.euronatur.org; EuroNatur magazines and brochures, f.ex. \"Save the Blue Heart of Europe\" (www.balkanrivers.net)", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2016", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "200000-299999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "6338624", "legal_status": "Foundation", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Lutz Ribbe", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "Director for Nature Conservation Policy"}
