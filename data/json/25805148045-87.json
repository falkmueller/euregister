ENTSO-E was established and given legal mandates\u200b by the EU\u2019s Third Legislative Package for the Internal Energy Market in 2009, which aims at further liberalising the gas and electricity markets in the EU. \nThe role of Transmission System Operators has considerably evolved with the Third Energy Package. Due to unbundling and the liberalisation of the energy market TSOs have become the meeting place for the various players to interact on the market place.  \nThe main objectives of ENTSO-E centre on the integration of renewable energy sources (RES) such as wind and solar power into the power system, and the completion of the internal energy market (IEM), which is central to meeting the European Union\u2019s energy policy objectives of affordability, sustainability and security of supply.  \nENTSO-E contributes to the achievement of these objectives mainly through: \n\u2022    the drafting of network codes \n\u2022    the development of pan-European network plans (TYNDPs) \n\u2022    the technical cooperation between TSOs \n\u2022    the publication of summer and winter outlook reports for electricity generation \n\u2022    the coordination of R&D plans.  \nENTSO-E aims to be the focal point for all technical, market and policy issues relating to TSOs and the European network, interfacing with power system users, EU institutions, regulators and national governments. \nThrough these deliverables, ENTSO-E is helping to build the world\u2019s largest electricity market, the benefits of which will not only be felt by all those in the energy sector but also by Europe\u2019s overall economy, today and into the future.", "industry_forums": "", "head_office_phone": "(+32)27410950", "level_of_interest": "European", "relevant_communication": "", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2016", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "50000-99999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "0", "legal_status": "AISBL", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "SUSANNE NIES", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "Corporate Affairs Manager"}
