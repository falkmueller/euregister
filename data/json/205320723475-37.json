ENC also specialises in alternative policy communication through multimedia platforms and audio-visual productions. \nSince its inception in early 2016, ENC has developed partnerships with non-governmental and governmental organisations across the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) area and wider Europe. It primarily works in the field of shared European neighbourhood objectives ranging from security and migration to development, democracy, and economic growth. \nAn important objective is to increase cooperation between academics from across the ENP area and wider Europe in order to understand the neighbourhoods\u2019 general concerns, research interests and shared policy solutions. Our five key-areas of interest include Democracy, Foreign Policy, Security, Economy and Education. \nENC tailors to a governmental and non-governmental policy audience, as well as academics, while using an interdisciplinary, representative and fair membership approach by including an equal number of academic council members from across the entire region. \nENC is registered and has its operating office in Brussels, Belgium. The organisations\u2019 advisory and academic council members are represented by academic representatives in each EU Member State, EU Accession Country, ENP country, and each of the five Central Asian republics. \n \nENC is an organisation that aims towards improved dialogue and neighbourhood coordination among EU Member States, EU Accession Countries, ENP countries and Central Asia.  \nThrough research, partnerships and events \u2013 we aim to narrow the foreign policy gap between existing member countries of the EU, neighbouring countries, and wider Europe. These efforts will enhance shared European values of democracy, security, economic growth, and education, while guaranteeing a stable, diverse and developing European neighbourhood. Represented cross-regionally in the Academic Council, ENC scholars provide the guiding platform for our activities on a yearly basis.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+32)026465139"}
