It also calls on the Commission, under the direction of the ECDC, to launch a multidisciplinary plan, in coordination with Member States, which will standardize screening, testing and treatment protocols, and which will eradicate hepatitis C by 2030. \nHepBCPPA in 2018 will monitor the progress following this resolution. \nWe hope that future Council Presidencies, such as the upcoming Council Presidency Trio of Romania, Finland and Croatia, will respond to the call of the European Parliament by adopting Council Conclusions on the topic. These Conclusions should mandate the European Commission to develop the pending EU Policy Framework on HIV/ Aids, Tuberculosis and Viral Hepatitis, and give guidance on how to expand the Dublin Declaration on HIV/ Aids in EU and neighbouring countries to include hepatitis and TB.
