Aggregates are a granular material used in construction. The most common natural aggregates of mineral origin are sand, gravel and crushed rock UEPG positively promotes the profile of the European Aggregates Industry and is the voice of UEPG Members in 26 European countries.  \n \nThe Industry produces 2.7 billion tonnes per year, comprises some 15,000 companies (mostly SMEs), producing at some 26,000 sites involving 200,000 employees (including contractors).  \n \nUEPG vision is a Sustainable Industry for a Sustainable Europe. Since 1987, UEPG has promoted the interests of the European Aggregates Industry by representing its National Member Associations on environmental and health & safety (two top priorities), economic and technical policy.  Also, UEPG increasingly contributes to enhance biodiversity, by providing appropriate ecosystems for both fauna and flora during and after our extraction activity. UEPG objectives are supplying essential Building Materials, Retaining Jobs, Contributing to Europe\u2019s Competitiveness, Partnering with Local Stakeholders, Contributing to Europe\u2019s Heritage within a Sustainable Production. \n \nUEPG identifies in a pro-active way EU initiatives and policies that are likely to impact on European aggregates producers. It provides Members with brief and concise information through regular publications and ad-hoc updates, and ensures UEPG positions are considered by EU decision-makers.
