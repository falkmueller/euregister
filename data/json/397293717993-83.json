In the Research and Development area, the company invests approximately 9% of reference turnover in the imaging diagnostics and medical devices sectors and has a portfolio comprising over 1,800 patents. \nBracco Imaging S.p.A. is the lead company in the Group's core business of diagnostic imaging where Bracco, thanks to an extensive and innovative portfolio of products and solutions, the fruit of in-house research, boasts a leading position at a global level. \nHeadquartered in Italy (Milan), Bracco Imaging is actively involved in the research, development, manufacture and marketing of diagnostic imaging solutions that respond to emerging medical challenges and facilitate clinical success. \nDiagnostic imaging products, better known as imaging agents, are pharmaceutical products used to improve diagnosis and procedure monitoring for various pathologies. Bracco Imaging offers a portfolio of products and diagnostic imaging solutions for all diagnostic techniques: X-ray (including Computerized Tomography), Magnetic Resonance, Ultrasound Imaging and Nuclear Medicine. The comprehensive portfolio also includes advanced imaging agent injection systems for radiology as well as decision support software and medical instruments for gastrointestinal radiology. \nBracco Imaging has invested heavily in operational systems to achieve high quality products and compliance with sustainable eco-friendly production in its manufacturing facilities, located in Italy (Ceriano Laghetto, Torviscosa and Colleretto Giacosa), Switzerland (Geneva), Japan (Saitama) and China (Shanghai). Bracco Imaging also boasts several research collaboration agreements with prestigious universities, hospital-based research centers and biotech companies in various parts of the world. \nFor years the Bracco Group has devoted considerable effort and substantial resources to R&D, pre-clinical and clinical development of contrast agents for diagnostic imaging. Contrast agents are used with special equipment in order to gain improved and more accurate information for diagnosis and for monitoring of minimally invasive operating procedures. Thanks also to the technologically advanced contrast agent systems available today, it is possible to achieve a very high level of diagnostic accuracy and a precise monitoring of interventions for the majority of pathologies. \nThe effort to protect the environment, which is essential for sustainable development, is the basis for the \nBracco culture that avails of a group of specialists dedicated to safety, health and ecology. \nThis is confirmed by the recent success in the sustainable management of residual wastewaters from an industrial plant, obtained thanks to a close collaboration between Bracco Research Centre and production units. \nAll activities currently conducted at the Group\u2019s industrial sites must comply with strict environmental protection requirements established by the Group itself in accordance with high standards of excellence. Bracco dedicates special attention to the assessments of environmental impact during the entire life cycle of its own products, from the experimental stage to manufacture, from packaging to disposal.
