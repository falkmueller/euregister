The organisation has been very successful at organising island communities across the country, identifying and addressing issues in partnership with islanders and state agencies including government departments and local authorities.  The organisation is a founder member and active participant of The European Small Islands Federation ( http://europeansmallislands.com ) and has successfully run a number of national and European programmes since its foundation including the National Rural Development Programme (2002-2006), Interreg IIIc and New Opportunities for Women Programme.  \n \nDue to new Government structural requirements for the delivery of the National Rural Development in 2008-09 Comhdh\u00e1il Oile\u00e1n na h\u00c9ireann setup a new LEADER delivery company; Comhar na nOile\u00e1n to deliver the programme on the islands. Since then the Comhdh\u00e1il has been active in addressing ongoing challenges faced by fragile communities on our offshore islands including social exclusion, healthcare, education, transport, communications, fisheries and agriculture. \n \nUnlike Comhar na Oile\u00e1in, the implementing body for LEADER, Comhdh\u00e1il is the only representative organization drawn from the population of offshore Island communities. Comhdh\u00e1il Oile\u00e1in na h\u00c9ireann has a mandate through our constitution and membership to act on  behalf of the offshore, permanently populated Islands of Ireland. \n \nComhdh\u00e1il Oile\u00e1in na hEireann\u2019s aim is to protect and develop island communities through representation and involvement in policy making at local, regional, national and European levels. A forum is provided for island groups and individuals to raise concerns about island issues, while creating communication links between Irish island communities as well as exchanging ideas and experiences with other European islands. \n  \nComhdh\u00e1il Oile\u00e1in na h\u00c9ireann has been working with some of the most disadvantaged groups, namely communities on the offshore islands, since its foundation thirty-one years ago.  The federation is committed to the overall development of island communities, especially their economic and cultural development and in so doing, fostering the full development of the individual in the island community. \n \nEducating the Government on key issues affecting Island life and sustainability is considered a core aim of the organization. Comhdh\u00e1il, as the only representative body for the Islands, who have been advising Government on policy relevant to Island communities since its formation, is uniquely placed for this role.  \n \nThe Comhdhail \u201cManifesto for the Islands\u201d sets out an agreed set of development aims, agreed by all island representatives. The manifesto puts a strong emphasis on enterprise/employment aims.  \n \nThe main aims are: \n\u25cf    Giving islanders a say through: \n\u25cf    recognizing the Islands as a region \n\u25cf    introducing an islands policy at all levels of government \n\u25cf    island proofing all legislation and programmes \n \n \nEnterprise and Employment Creation through: \n\u25cf    Establishment of a Special Enterprise Fund for Islands \n\u25cf    support for traditional industries including agriculture and fishing \n\u25cf    development of Natural Resources \n\u25cf    provision of drive-on drive-off ferry facilities \n \nReducing the cost of living difference through: \n\u25cf    introducing Tax Incentives for Island Locations \n\u25cf    free passenger travel for islanders \n\u25cf    reduced freight charges with quay to door delivery \n\u25cf    forced mainland stays paid for by deciding authority \n \nEncouragement of the Young to stay through: \n\u25cf    new job creation \n\u25cf    provision of adequate facilities and services \n\u25cf    sympathetic and understanding planning regime \n \nImprovement of infrastructure through: \n\u25cf    guaranteeing high quality and reliable electricity supply \n\u25cf    extension of broadband telecom services to islands", "industry_forums": "", "inter_groups": "", "number_of_persons_involved": "2", "relevant_communication": "Slow adventure on Islands (Tourism project) \nCherish Project (Entrepreneurship project \nFrysbee project (blue social growth for young persons) \nIsland produce branding \nComhdhail will participate in ESIN 's AGM IN Brussels this year and will engage with Irish MEP'S on territorial cohesion to ensure they understand the islands situation before the vote takes place on the policy.", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2017", "lat": 53.8247395, "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "2552", "legal_status": "Charity", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "John Walsh", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "ESIN representative", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+353)872212073"}
