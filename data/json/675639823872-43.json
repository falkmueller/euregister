It aims are  \n  \n \nI. to co-ordinate actions related to primatology between the different European societies including \nA. the circulation of information between the different national societies and groups in Europe. Folia Primatologica, published by Karger S.A., Basel, is the official publication of the Federation. \nB. meetings of the the national societies, specialist groups and workshops, scientific activities, research and educational projects related to primatology \nII. to promote national management of captive primates and to make studies on primates available to a maximum of students and researchers \nIII. to participate through the European Commission on decisions relevant to primate use in captive research \n \nCurrently 9 European countries are affiliated to the EFP: Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Switzerland, The Netherlands, Portugal and the United Kingdom.  \nThe EFP groups people involved in fundamental non-invasive and invasive research, applied biomedical research and zoo management. This accounts for more than 1500 scientists, graduate students and zoo managers.  \n \n \nThe aims of all affiliated societies or groups are identical to those of the International Primatological Society (IPS), i.e. to encourage all areas of non-human primatological scientific research, to facilitate cooperation among scientists of all nationalities engaged in primate research, and to promote the conservation of all primate species.  \nProtection of captive primates is one of the most important aims of the EFP, practically this means the improvement of the well-being of primates.  \nTherefore the EFP intends to promote the dialogue with all people involved in primatology and to promote studies providing scientific evidence on primate welfare issues.  \nThe EFP will strive to promote the implementation of the \"International Primatological Society Guidelines for the acquisition, care, and breeding of non-human primates\". \n \nThe EFP considers its independence from private interests as necessary for its scientific expertise. Consequently the EFP will not sponsor any activities related to private commercial interests.  \nHowever, the EFP provides the scientific experience for all people and organizations interested whenever non-human primates are affected.", "industry_forums": "", "head_office_phone": "(+39)0649902107", "level_of_interest": "European", "relevant_communication": "The resultsof the EWG are published, in forms of documents and recommendations, in the webpage of the European Commission", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2017", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "0-9999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "9978", "legal_status": "federazioni di societ\u00e0 nazionali", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Augusto Vitale", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "Dottorato in Biologia"}
