Every year over two-thirds of adults participate in the wide range of social, sporting, cultural and humanitarian activities and services offered by over 19,000 of these organisations. \n \nThese organisations are active at every level of society, and they play an essential role in delivering social and public services, such as healthcare, education, housing, poverty relief, the arts, sport and the protection of our environment and heritage. \n \nEach community, voluntary and charity organisation has its own mission and outlook, but they share many challenges, such as delivering effective services, fundraising, engaging with the State, complying with regulations and managing staff and volunteers. \n \nThe Wheel was established to address these shared challenges and to help develop an environment in which community and voluntary activity wil flourish. \n \nMembership of The Wheel offers you opportunities to work together, access to the most up-to-date information, dedicated support services, unrivalled networking opportunities and the ability to influence policy-makers.", "identification_number": "698118830697-15", "fields_of_interest": "Agriculture, Humanitarian aid and civil protection, Culture and media, Budget, Culture, International co-operation and development, Education and training, Employment and Social Affairs, Environment, Youth, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Climate Action, Communication", "head_office_address": "48 Fleet St, Temple Bar", "full_time_equivalent_fte": "2", "person_with_legal_responsibility": "Deirdre Garvey", "industry_forums": "", "grants": "50000", "inter_groups": "", "eu_initiatives": "The Wheel is an experienced, cooperative and willing partner in European projects and in the delivery of contracts on behalf of European institutions.  Since 2013, we have operated four projects funded by DG Communications for the promotion of citizen engagement with the European Parliament and in August 2017 we were delighted to win the tender to play a support role to the European Parliament Information Office in Ireland as they roll out the European Ambassador School Programme between now and 2019.  This exciting programme aims to raise awareness amongst young people in secondary education of the impact of the European Union in their daily lives. This free programme offers an engaging and interactive format, creative training material for various levels, and provides the opportunity to participate in debate, discussion and events around European Parliament affairs in Ireland.  \nAs the National Contact Point for the Europe for Citizens Programme in Ireland since 2015, The Wheel also promotes understanding and interaction between EU institutions and citizens, deepening their awareness of what it means to be European and supporting the design of transnational projects that develop a sense of European identity. In the 2018 Work Programme for Europe for Citizens, the Future of Europe is a priority and so this is a topic that The Wheel regularly promotes to beneficiaries in Ireland and an area that we are very comfortable in communicating around. Our Twitter account @EU4Citizens has over 1000 followers and regularly encourages discussion on European issues. See here.  \nIn addition to the above, The Wheel operated a capacity building service called Access Europe for civil society on how to access European Union funding. It promoted the value of European working and European active citizenship. Activities included training, information sharing and discussion on topics of a European nature plus the provision of technical advice on European funding applications.   \nWe have recently been given the role of supporting the Irish Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in the organisation and facilitation of their Citizens\u2019 Dialogue on the Future of Europe for Community and Voluntary Organisations, which is due to take place in Dublin on the 5 April 2018.  \nLed by the European Programmes Coordinator and supported by the European Programme Officer, The Wheel\u2019s range of European activity is growing annually and rapidly in reach.", "level_of_interest": "European, national, regional/local", "organisation_name": "Rotha t/a The Wheel", "belgium_office_post_code": "", "number_of_persons_involved": "2", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Hugh O'Reilly", "section": "III - Non-governmental organisations", "source": "", "subsection": "Non-governmental organisations, platforms and networks and similar", "belgium_office_phone": "", "overall_budget_turnover_as_a_range": "", "belgium_office_address": "", "no_geo_reference": true, "persons_accredited_for_access_to_european_parliament_premises": "", "registration_date": "08/03/2018", "estimate_of_costs_absolute_amount": "50000", "website_address": "http://www.wheel.ie", "commission_expert_groups_and_other_similar_entities_european_commission": "NA", "head_office_post_box": "", "head_office_city": "Dublin", "membership": "We are members of ENNA: https://ennaeurope.eu/ \n \nENNA is a network brings together organisations, platforms, and associations working at a national level to promote the cross-sectoral interests of the civil society sector.
