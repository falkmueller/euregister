In 2002 amendments to the EUROLAB Articles of Association were initiated to cope more with the international laboratory behaviour. Since and through co-operation with European and international technological partner organisations, through regular contacts with the European Commission and the European and international accreditation bodies (EA, ILAC)   and through representation in standardisation committees (CEN, ISO), EUROLAB can effectively represent the interests of its members which are made up of four categories of members, i.e. 21 Active Members, 3 Associated Members, 1 Observer Member and 2 International Members, including i.a. NCSLI (National conference of standards laboratories International - USA) and NLA (National laboratory association of South Africa).", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+32)2 511 50 65"}
