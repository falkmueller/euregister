At the end of 2013, there were 345 member churches. While the bulk of the WCC's founding churches were European and North American, today most member churches are in Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, Latin America, the Middle East and the Pacific. \n \nFor its member churches, the WCC is a unique space: one in which they can reflect, speak, act, worship and work together, challenge and support each other, share and debate with each other. As members of this fellowship, WCC member churches: \n \n-are called to the goal of visible unity in one faith and one eucharistic fellowship; \n \n-promote their common witness in work for mission and evangelism; \n \n-engage in Christian service by serving human need, breaking down barriers between people, seeking justice and peace, and upholding the integrity of creation; and \n \n-foster renewal in unity, worship, mission and service.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+41)227916111"}
