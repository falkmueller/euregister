Founded in 2003, Tesla designs, manufactures and markets all-electric battery vehicles together with solutions for renewable energy production and storage. We want to be a catalyst for larger and broader investments in sustainable energy options. \nAll Tesla vehicles are 100% battery electric, with a driving range sufficient to completely replace internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. Each generation of Tesla vehicles is one step further towards democratising electric cars as a genuine alternative to ICE vehicles \u2013 for short as well as long distance travelling. Starting with a sport car (Roadster, cumulative global sales 2,500), in 2017 we delivered over 100,000 of our second generation of premium all-electric family vehicles (Model S and Model X) and started delivering our third, and more affordable mass-market, \u2018Model 3\u2019. In early spring 2018, we produced 4,000 vehicles per week. The global Tesla fleet has covered over 10bn electric kilometres. \nTesla Semi, a full-size heavy truck unveiled in November 2017, will have a transformative impact due total cost of ownership that is superior to diesel trucks. Tesla Semi combines a real-world range of up to 800km and has been designed to dramatically improve safety not only for the driver and cargo, but also for pedestrians, cyclists and other cars on the road. \nTesla is investing heavily in recharging infrastructure to create a no-compromise EV experience. Tesla\u2019s pan-European motorway-charging network (\u201cSupercharger Network\u201d) enables EV customers to travel across Europe using only renewably sourced electricity. At the end of 2017, we operated 1,128 supercharger locations worldwide of which almost 400 in Europe. This enables our customers to drive from the North of Norway to the South of Spain, while recharging times are about 30 minutes per 250 km driving range.  Through our \u201cDestination Charging\u201d program, started in 2016, we are also supporting the larger tourism industry (hotels, restaurants, touristic resorts, etc.) in providing charging solutions for all EV users. \nTo support the development of renewably produced electricity, Tesla launched small and large-scale stationary battery storage solutions in 2015. For individual owners, Tesla\u2019s \u201cPowerwall\u201d solution enables self-consumption of locally produced electricity or deferred electricity consumption to off-peak hours, as well as ensures continuation of supply in the event of a power failure. For industrial customers, Tesla\u2019s \u201cPowerpack\u201d solution enables larger storage projects and grid services applications. On December 1, 2017, we completed installation of the largest battery in the world ahead of schedule in South Australia and we are planning to open the largest European battery in Belgium in May 2018. \nTesla started delivering \u2018solar roof\u2019 solutions to enable renewable electricity production from people\u2019s own roofs. Tesla\u2019s solution is different from traditional solar panels: our solar tiles hide a photovoltaic cell within a true imitation of traditional roof tiles. Through the production of electricity, Tesla\u2019s solar roof tiles will actually be cheaper than conventional roofs.  \n \nTesla is headquartered in Palo Alto, California, USA, and employs some 37,000 people worldwide (April 2018). Tesla\u2019s main productions capacities are currently located in Fremont, California, Reno, Nevada and Buffalo, New York. In 2017 global revenue amounted $11.8bn/\u20ac9.7bn. \nOur European footprint is growing quickly. We operate an assembly facility in Tilburg, the Netherlands, and Tesla Grohmann Automation in Pr\u00fcm, Germany, develops technologies for advanced manufacturing processes. Tesla\u00b4s European Headquarter is located in Amsterdam, Netherlands. We have around 4,500 employees across Europe and around 100 sales and service centres.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+1)650-681-5000"}
