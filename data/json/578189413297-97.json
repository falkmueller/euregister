This includes support in promoting legitimate interests and recommendations for optimal organisational structures in the areas Governmental Relations and Corporate Affairs. Our consulting approach is based on following principles: \n\u2022 Societal trends not only require companies to permanently reassess their market position and, where necessary, adjust their business model, they also offer new business and growth opportunities. \n\u2022 Positioning companies strategically requires pro-active commitment to good corporate citizenship. \n\u2022 Only an integrated stakeholder approach that consistently targets all parties critical to corporate success creates a solid foundation for sustainable corporate success. \n\u2022 On-going monitoring of the political and regulatory environment and the credible promotion of legitimate interests secure the \"licence to operate\" and create new business and growth opportunities. \n \nWe are active in following segments: \n\u2022 Corporate Strategy: We analyse the impact of a company's political, societal and corporate environment on its business model and develop possible approaches that reduce potential risks while creating new opportunities. \n\u2022 Strategic positioning: We advise companies regarding the strategic positioning in the political and societal landscape. \n\u2022 Public Affairs M&A: Social and political goodwill have become a critical success factor for M&A transactions. Of particular importance is the political dimension of merger control procedures in major cross-border transactions. \nCompetition and trade cases: Cartels and market abuses, state aid and trade disputes \u2013 the result of competition procedures by the EU Commission are of enormous importance to the affected companies and industry sectors. In order to be successful, a sensible political and communication approach alongside the formal legal procedure is key.  \n\u2022 Advocacy: We support companies in credibly promoting legitimate interests by engaging with policy makers, regulators and the public. \n\u2022 CEO positioning / CEO Start: We advise clients in developing suitable strategies for the positioning of CEO\u2019s and their companies.  \n\u2022 Structural Review:We help companies to optimally align their organisation and processes with the needs of external and internal stakeholders. \n\u2022 Corporate social responsibility: We advise companies in developing and implementing tailored, credible CR strategies.", "belgium_office_city": "Brussels", "head_office_phone": "(+49)211430790"}
