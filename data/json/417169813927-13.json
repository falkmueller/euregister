Nationwide is a market leader in providing banking services but we are not a bank \u2013 we are a mutual building society. We are owned by and run for the benefit of our 15 million members, who include our retail savings and mortgage customers. As such we are unique in UK retail financial services, providing a credible alternative to the plc banks and focusing on long-term, transparent customer relationships. Whilst our core business is residential mortgage lending funded by retail deposits, we are a full service personal finance provider, offering current accounts, personal loans, credit cards, investments and insurance.   \n \nThe principles on which we are run are fundamentally different to those of our plc peers \u2013 we exist to deliver value to our member customers and we are accountable to them.  We are able to optimise profit \u2013 rather than maximise profit \u2013 to deliver member value over the longer term through improved pricing and market-leading customer service.  This results in a lower risk appetite and profile than that of our peers meaning we have remained safe and secure throughout the financial crisis with capital and liquidity ratios amongst the highest in our peer group.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+44)1793 513513"}
