We are the region\u2019s leading network of feminist organizations and advocates. Our 220 members represent groups of diverse women from 26 countries in Asia Pacific. APWLD\u2019s strength lies in the diversity, experience, expertise and commitment the members bring to the organization. Established in 1986 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, APWLD has been actively advocating for women\u2019s human rights for 30 years. The secretariat relocated to Chiang Mai, Thailand in 1997. \n \nAPWLD fosters feminist movements in Asia Pacific to impact policies and practices at the local, national, regional, and international level. We develop capacities, produce and disseminate feminist analyses, conduct advocacy, and foster networks and spaces for movement building to claim and strengthen women\u2019s human rights. We also empower women in the region to use law as an instrument of change for equality, justice, peace, and development. \n \nAPWLD\u2019s current strategic plan (2017-2021) is focused on advancing development justice across our programmes and the diverse platforms that we engage as well as on building movements of women\u2019s rights advocates at grassroots, regional, and international levels. This focus is based on the conclusion of our last external review, which found that APWLD \u201cis most effective when it mobilizes these networks across specific policies and platforms and amplifies marginalized voices in the policy making arena.\u201d We also draw on recent research demonstrating that the existence of strong and autonomous feminist and women\u2019s movements is a key determinant in progressive policy making.  The five-year plan aims to amplify our successes and strengthen the four domains identified in our theory of change: capacity, analysis, advocacy, and movements.  \n \nOur overarching goals for APWLD\u2019s current strategic planning period are:  \n1.    To build and strengthen feminist movements at local, national, and regional levels particularly of the most marginalized; \n2.    To amplify the influence, impact, and voice of Asia Pacific women in global and regional policy setting bodies to transform international, regional, and national norms, standards, and frameworks to be more just, sustainable, and rights based; \n3.    To facilitate the production of evidence-based research and tools for advocacy outcomes and movement building; and \n4.    To build the capacity of women\u2019s rights organizations and activists in the region to use rights-based perspectives and to interrogate the intersections of patriarchy, globalization, fundamentalism, and militarization.", "industry_forums": "", "head_office_phone": "(+66)53284527", "level_of_interest": "regional/local", "relevant_communication": "Details of all recent publications and resources can be found online: http://apwld.org/category/resources-and-publications/ \n \nCampaign details can be found here: http://apwld.org/category/campaigns/", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2016", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "50000-99999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "910358", "legal_status": "Association", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Kate Lappin", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "Regional Coordinator"}
