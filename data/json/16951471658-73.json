"CECA is a banking association committed to promoting, defending, and representing its associated companies' interests, giving them advice, and cementing their social mission. \n \nCECA is regulated specifically by the additional eleventh provision of Savings Banks and Foundations Act 26/2013, of 27 December. The provision reads: \n \n1.The Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks, set up in accordance with the framework existing prior to this Act coming into force, will be made up of savings banks, banking foundations, and credit institutions, to form a whole and maintain the functions and aims they hold in accordance with the aforementioned framework and any others outlined in their statutes. \n \n2.The Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks will lose its status as a credit institution when the statutes mentioned in the previous section are brought into force, without prejudice to its ability to offer services through any other participating bank, in the terms established by its statutes. \n \nCECA adopts as a fundamental principle and standard of conduct the preservation of the character and independence of its members. \n \nAt CECA we work on the dissemination and promotion of a retail banking model, prioritizing financing to families and SMEs. \n \nCECA's main goals, as a banking association, divide its activity into four key elements: \n \n1. Institutional Representation: Through which it defends its members' interests in national and international forums. \n \n2. Economic and Regulatory Analysis: CECA carries out a comprehensive analysis of regulations in all the fields that can have a potential impact on its partners. Furthermore, it conducts economic studies that will be of interest to its members. \n \n3. Social Investment: One of the principal hallmarks of the companies affiliated to CECA is that they carry out their activities in a responsible way. The association works to disseminate and promote Social Investment, both in terms of Obra Social and CSR, from a sectorial perspective. \n \n4. Work Relations: The objective of CECA, as the employers' association of savings banks and institutions, is to defend the associated institutions that are bound by the Savings Banks and Financial Institutions Collective Agreement. \n \nThe 9 financial institutions represented by CECA account for (data December 2017):  \nTotal assets of 789,483 EUR Mill. \n32% of the sector in total assets.  \n39% of the Spanish financial system in terms of deposits.  \n12,246 branches in Spain (45% of Spanish Financial System) \n Workforce of 72,344 employees (39% of Spanish Financial System)", "industry_forums": "", "head_office_phone": "(+34)915965000", "level_of_interest": "European, national", "relevant_communication": "", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2017", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "50000-99999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "0", "legal_status": "Asociaci\u00f3n nacional", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "M\u00f3nica Malo", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "Director of Communication and External Relations"}
