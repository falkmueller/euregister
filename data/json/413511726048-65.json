Founded in 1824, the RSPCA is the world\u2019s oldest animal protection organisation. Our Science Group consists of 40 animal welfare scientists and technical staff whose work encompasses four areas of concern: companion, farm, wild and laboratory animals. (1) We work to improve the welfare of companion animals by ensuring that every pet is cared for properly and has a good home; ending cruelty to pet animals; raising standards for pet animals worldwide; stopping pet overpopulation. (2) We aim to improve the lives and reduce the suffering of farm animals by: aiming to have all UK farmed animals kept to RSPCA higher welfare standards; improving farm animal welfare legislation and ensuring it is enforced; encouraging consumers to replace meat, eggs and dairy products with those from higher welfare production systems; ensuring animal products are properly labelled so consumers can make higher welfare choices; stopping the live export of farm animals for slaughter from the UK. (3) We aim to improve the welfare of wild animals by: stopping the use of wild animals in circuses; making it socially unacceptable to hunt and kill any wild animals in the name of sport; ensuring any use of performing animals in the UK follows appropriate guidelines; stopping the keeping of exotic animals as pets in unsuitable conditions; stopping the ivory trade. (4) We aim to reduce the use and suffering of animals in experiments by: ensuring animal use is challenged - ethically and scientifically; working to replace animal experiments, reduce animal numbers and suffering, and improve welfare; raising standards of regulation, animal welfare and ethical review in the UK and internationally; working to end 'severe' suffering in animal experiments; promoting open and honest debate about animal use.  \nIn England & Wales our 340 animal protection inspectors investigate animal cruelty, advise owners on appropriate care of animals and rescue trapped, lost or injured animals. Our 50+ animal centres take in and treat more than 120,000 companion and wild animals annually. \nRSPCA Assured is the world\u2019s largest high welfare farm assurance and food labelling scheme. Under the scheme 50% of the UK\u2019s laying hens, 30% of pigs, and more than 80% of farmed salmon are reared to the RSPCA\u2019s farm animal standards. The RSPCA leads the AssureWel international project to implement, monitor and assess the application of Welfare Outcome Assessment to high welfare farm assurance schemes across Europe. \nRSPCA International is responsible for multilateral relations, policy development and programmes and is active in around 30 countries in Europe, Asia and Africa. We work with multilateral partners such as the OIE and FAO, government departments, animal protection/conservation/development NGOs, commercial companies, academic institutions etc - to deliver a programme of aid, training and consultancy to promote the development and enforcement of animal protection and wildlife law, animal welfare education, animal rescue and rehoming, humane dog population management, laboratory animal welfare, improvements in the rearing, transport and slaughter of farm animals, and animal welfare components of CSR policies. The RSPCA also has an emergency response capacity with particular expertise in oil spill and flood relief.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+44)300123000"}
