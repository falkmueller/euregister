LeanShips is one of the first projects funded under the \nnew European Research and Innovation Framework Program HORIZON 2020. \n \nThe project is coordinated by Damen Shipyards Group and jointly managed by the Netherlands Maritime Technology Foundation (NMT), the Center of Maritime Technologies (CMT) from Germany and Cetena, the Italian Ship Research Centre. \n \nLeanShips officially started on 1 May 2015 with a grant of 17 million Euro. The large project partnership consists of ship owners, shipyards, equipment suppliers and research institutes. In total, 46 partners (81% from industry) from 12 EU member states and one associated country are part of the project. \n \nLeanShips aims to put innovations into practice by carrying out eight demonstrator show cases that combine technologies for efficient and less polluting vessels with end-users\u2019 needs and requirements. Dedicated teams of equipment manufacturers (technology providers), shipyards (technology integrators) and ship owners (technology users) as well as rule makers will make certain that the innovations developed in the project are matured to market uptake capability.", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2015", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "50000-99999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "0", "legal_status": "B.V.
