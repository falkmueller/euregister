Regulators on local, national, and supranational levels keep regulating more and more areas of consumers' lives. This leads to less consumer choice and usually higher costs. \nWhether protectionism in the airline industry prevents more efficient airlines to sell cheaper tickets to passengers, excessive taxation of consumption serve as letters of indulgence, or branding bans destroy the brand value of companies. Consumers don't benefit but suffer from such regulation. \nIn some cases paternalistic regulations cause even harm. Examples can be seen in more driving under influence cases in cities after banning ride-sharing services such as Uber or smokers being unable to switch to less harmful ways of consuming nicotine such as vaporizers. Branding bans lead to a higher accidental consumption of counterfeited products that can be of lethal consequence for the consumer.", "industry_forums": "We monitor consumer choice among Industry forums.", "inter_groups": "We monitor consumer choice among Intergroups", "number_of_persons_involved": "7", "relevant_communication": "We create a dialogue between consumers and industries and see B2C as a healthy relationship that does not need overregulation and overprotection. \n \n\u2022 We are the voice for Consumer Choice in Civil Society. \n \n\u2022 Work with a Creative Campaigning Powerhouse that exposes consumers to the threat of not being able to chose your products or services. \n \n\u2022 We disseminate your industry\u2019s threats for Consumer Choice to mainstream and social media. \n \n\u2022 We empower consumers to speak up for Consumer Choice. \n \nhttps://www.consumerchoicecenter.org/launch-event/ \nhttps://www.consumerchoicecenter.org/canada-event/", "financial_year_end_date": "01/04/2017", "lat": 38.853901, "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "100000-199999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "3761438", "legal_status": "NGO / 501(C)3", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Luca Bertoletti", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "European Affairs Manager", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+39)3451694519"}
