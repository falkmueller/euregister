Regulators on local, national, and supranational levels keep regulating more and more areas of consumers' lives.

Consumers don't benefit but suffer from such regulation. \nIn some cases paternalistic regulations cause even harm. Examples can be seen in more driving under influence cases in cities after banning ride-sharing services such as Uber or smokers being unable to switch to less harmful ways of consuming nicotine such as vaporizers. Branding bans lead to a higher accidental consumption of counterfeited products that can be of lethal consequence for the consumer.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+39)3451694519"}
