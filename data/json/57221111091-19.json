Justice & Environment is a non-governmental, non-partisan and non-governmental independent association  of public interest environmental law organisations, based in the EU member states. J&E aims to use law to protect people, the environment and nature. Our primary goal is to ensure the implementation and enforcement of the EU legislation through the use of European law and exchange of information.J&E works on the EU and national levels. Internationally, J&E focuses on implementation and transposition of horizontal legal issues. The strong grass roots contacts of our members encouraged J&E to concentrate on horizontal problems with the Aarhus Convention and related legislation, Environmental impact assessment, Environmental Liability, pollution, Natura 2000, Transport and organisational capacity. The network has a unique ability to analyse and evaluate the implementation of the environmental acquis in EU Member States. We provide an expert, comparative perspective in identifying and assessing gaps in the implementation of existing EU environmental provisions. J&E also evaluates the impact that new EU environmental provisions can have on Member States given the specific characteristics of their legal systems, economic development and natural environment. Our work provides a public record of information not otherwise available, in the form of legal analysis, case studies, position papers and subsequent communication of this message to decision makers. \n \nFull members of J&E are: \n    * EELC - Estonian Environmental Law Center, Estonia \n    * EMLA - Environmental Management and Law Association, Hungary \n    * FBS - Frank Bold Society, Czech Republic \n    * OEKOBUERO \u2013 Coordination Bureau of Austrian Environmental NGOs - Austria \n    * PIC Center for Public Acvocacy, Slovenia \n    * Via Iuris - Slovakia \n \nAssociated members: \n    * The Association for Environmental Justice (Spain), \n    * Centre for Legal Resources (Romania), \n    * Front 21/42 (Macedonia), \n    * International Institute for Law and the Environment (Spain), \n    * Legal Information Centre (Slovenia), \n    * Milieukontakt (Netherlands) \n    * Zelena Akcija (Croatia) \n \nFor more information please visit http://www.justiceandenvironment.org \n \nFBS is member of OECD Watch.

ECCJ calls for better EU regulation to ensure that European companies consider their social and environmental impacts and mitigate them where they are negative.  \n \nWhen registering in this lobby register, we have chosen to give all relevant information that we consider necessary for lobbying transparency. A credible EU lobbying transparency register should include names of individual lobbyists and the issues that they try to influence, provide precise and comparable financial information on lobbying, and have effective sanctions to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information disclosed. In an effort to arrive at a more objective way of calculating lobbying expenditures, we follow guidelines that result from consultations with public interest organisations, professionals working on lobby transparency as well as experts of US lobby disclosure legislation. Our registration is therefore providing a more comprehensive calculation of our expenses for activities that aim to influence the policy formulation and decision-making processes of the European institutions, and a list of those who carry out such activities.", "industry_forums": "", "head_office_phone": "(+420)545575229", "level_of_interest": "European, global, national, regional/local", "relevant_communication": "Accessible at: \nhttp://en.frankbold.org", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2016", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "10000-24999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "637806", "legal_status": "non-profit organisation - civic association", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Filip Gregor", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "Head of Responsible Companies"}
