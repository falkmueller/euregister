It is a non-profit and independent institute with the legal form of a limited liability company (GmbH). ZEW was founded in 1990 on the basis of a public-private initiative in the Federal State of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg in co-operation with the University of Mannheim. \n \nZEW's guiding mission is to study the \"optimal performance of markets and institutions in Europe\". To this end, ZEW applies a plurality of methodologies, with a clear focus on microeconomic and microeconometric research. The institute co-operates closely with other scientific disciplines to address research questions. In this context, the research institute distinguishs itself, inter alia, in the analysis of internationally comparative questions in the European context and in the creation of data bases which are eminently important as a basis for scientific research. In addition, ZEW provides external persons and bodies with excerpts of selected data stocks for the purpose of scientific research. \n \nEvaluations in regular intervals ensure the quality of the work performed in the research units and its orientation towards the institute's research programme. Evaluations are carried out by the Scientific Advisory Council of ZEW, which is composed of renowned German and foreign scientists as well as of executives from the economy and public administration.", "industry_forums": "", "head_office_phone": "(+49)621123501", "level_of_interest": "European, global, national, regional/local", "relevant_communication": "1) Participation in EU funded research projects:  \n \nH2020 projects (ongoing): \n- European Global Transition Network on Eco-Innovation, Green Economy and Sustainable Development (green.eu) \n- Coordination and Assessment of Research and Innovation in Support of Climate Migration Actions (CARISMA) \n- Investigating the Impact of the Innovation Union  (I3U) \n- Step by step commitments for energy saving (STEP_BY_STEP) \n \nFP7: 16 projects (completeted or still ongoing)  \n \n2) ZEW Lunch Debates (URL: http://www.zew.de/en/veranstaltungen-und-weiterbildung/veranstaltungen-fuer-die-oeffentlichkeit/zew-lunch-debates/): \nZEW hosts the quarterly ZEW Lunch Debates in Brussels.
