CSD is a non-partisan, independent organization fostering the reform process in Europe through impact on policy and civil society. \n \nCSD objectives are: \n\u2022 to provide an enhanced institutional and policy capacity for a successful European integration process, especially in the area of justice and home affairs; \n\u2022 to promote institutional reform and the practical implementation of democratic values in legal and economic practice; \n\u2022 to monitor public attitudes and serve as a watchdog of the institutional reform process. \nBuilding bridges is the old-fashioned way of bringing together social actors and cementing new alliances. Born as a think-tank, the Center for the Study of Democracy has evolved into policy development through dialogue and partnership.  \n \nBringing cutting-edge solutions to transition problems is our way of keeping the middle ground between academia and social practice. \n \nThe CSD has pioneered in several areas traditionally perceived as the inviolable public property, such as anti-corruption institutional reform, and national security. \nOur belief is that bringing a new culture of cooperation and trust in a milieu of inherited fragmentation and opacity is equally rewarding as the achievement of concrete social goals.", "industry_forums": "", "head_office_phone": "(+3592)9713000", "level_of_interest": "European, national, regional/local", "relevant_communication": "Selected Projects:  \nJudicial Strategy Against all Forms of Violent Extremism in Prison (J-SAFE), European Commission, JUST-AG-2016, 2018 (Partner) \nAdapting Learning in Inclusive Communities and Environment (ALICE), European Commission, Erasmus+, 2018 (Partner) \nInnovative Methods to Investigate Fraud and Corruption in EU funding for agriculture (HERCAGRO), European Commission, OLAF-D.1, 2018 \nInterim evaluation of the Internal Security Fund \u2013 Police (2014-2017), European Commission,  \nDG Migration and Home Affairs, 2017 (Partner) \nIntegrated Community, Probation, and Prison Services Radicalisation Prevention Approach (INTEGRA), Erasmus+ KA2, 2017 (Partner) \nPro Victims Justice through an Enhanced Rights Protection and Stakeholders Cooperation (PRO VICTIMS JUSTICE), European Commission, DG Justice and Consumers, 2017 \nPreventing and Combatting Racism and Xenophobia through Social Orientation of Non-Nationals (RACCOMBAT), European Commission, DG Justice and Consumers, 2017 \nAssessing the risk of isolation of suspects and accused (ARISA), European Commission, DG Justice and Consumers, 2017 (Coordinator) \nFinancing Organised Crime Activities \u2013 focus on Human Trafficking, (FINOCA 2.0), 2017 (Coordinator) \nEnhancing the Integration of Women, Beneficiaries of International Protection by Development and Implementation of Multifaceted Integration Trainings (INTEGRA-TRAIN), European Commission, Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (2014-2020), 2017 (Coordinator) \nEnabling the Energy Union through understanding the drivers of individual and collective energy choices in Europe, (Enable.EU), 2016 (Partner) \n \nSelected Publications:  \nPrivate Sector Corruption in Bulgaria.
