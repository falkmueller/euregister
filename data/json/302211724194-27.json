Co-funded at the level of 360M Euro by DG Regio through the European Regional and Development Fund (ERDF), the Extreme Light Infrastructure (ELI) project is a pan-European Research Infrastructure aimed at exploring new regimes of light-matter interactions. As a world-class research infrastructure project carried out by EU Members with the financial support of the European Union, ELI is clearly an unprecedented venture in its scientific objective, organisation, funding and management but also in the important innovations expected from its development.  \nELI was approved by the European Commission for co-funding based on a premise to contribute to the development of hosting regions, hosting countries and Europe, in the context of the Lisbon agenda. As the ELI-NP project \u2013 one of the three existing pillars of ELI \u2013 is now halfway through its implementation phase, with the major contracts for civil engineering and scientific instruments signed, the time has come to focus on a plan for ELI-NP to deliver the socio-economic impact its main donor aims at achieving.  \nCLARA \u2013 CONCEPT, OBJECTIVES, STRATEGY, CAPACITY \nContext. The present-day Magurele Platform features a lack of industrial innovative activities and technology transfer towards SMEs and companies in general, translating in a risk of low socio-economic impact from recent major investments co-financed by the European Commission and the Romanian Government (CETAL, ELI-NP). An effective innovation ecosystem is necessary to deliver the expected socio-economic impact; CLARA, the technology cluster has been conceived to maximise the delivered socio-economic impact. \nConcept and objectives. The CLARA project is conceived as a Key-Enabling Technology (KET) cluster providing services to research institutions, academic institutions and companies \u2013 foremost among which SMEs \u2013 with a full range of services, facilitating RDI activities from TRL 1 to 9 and technology transfer. CLARA has been conceived to cover: \n\u2022 the Industrial Policy Priorities (nanotechnologies, micro and nano-electronics, photonics, advanced materials, biotechnology, space and security, life sciences and advanced manufacturing systems); \n\u2022 the Digital Agenda policy; \n\u2022 the Industrial Policy for the Globalisation Era, launched by the European Commission in 2014; \n\u2022    the Innovation Union concept applied in the area of Regional Policy; \nCLARA is an integrated cluster providing support and solutions to research institutions, academic institutions and industries alike, aiming at developing local companies, attracting foreign companies in the Southern Ilfov region, and developing KET activities. CLARA founding members count more than 5,000 researchers and academic members. \nCLARA integrates the three pillars necessary to cross the \u201cValley of Death\u201d: fundamental research, laboratory proof of concept, technological research, product development, extensive testing and competitive manufacturing.", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2016", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "8400", "legal_status": "NON - PROFIT ASSOCIATION", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "MARIUS EUGEN OPRAN", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "President of the Board of Directors"}
