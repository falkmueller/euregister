Our primary objective is the introduction of policies and practices related to the open sharing of resources, with particular focus on public resources. We also advocate the use of digital technologies for the public interest, and the development of policies in support of this goal. Our principal areas of work are policymaking and outreach with a focus on open education, openness of public resources and copyright reform. \n \nWe also conduct qualitative and quantitative research on the impact of technology on cultural and educational practices in the society, which provides evidence base for our policy work. We are the institutional lead of Creative Commons Poland and founding member of the Polish Coalition for Open Education (KOED), Communia Association on the Digital Public Domain and the Open Policy Network. \n \nBased on our experience and research conducted up to date, we believe that a complex, multidisciplinary approach is necessary in order to develop a digital society - defned through three main pillars of activity: education (\u201cknowing what to do\u201d), development of content and services (\u201chaving a reason to do it\u201d), and infrastructure (\u201chaving means to do it\u201d).", "industry_forums": "", "head_office_phone": "(+48)533 951 925", "level_of_interest": "European, global, national, regional/local", "relevant_communication": "Advocacy work in Communia Association: \n \nThe Copyright Reform \u2013 a Guide for the Perplexed http://www.communia-association.org/2016/11/02/copyright-reform-guide-perplexed/ \n \nBest Case Scenarios for Copyright http://www.communia-association.org/2016/06/06/bcs-copyright/", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2017", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "25000-49999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "307050", "legal_status": "fundacja", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Aleksander Tarkowski", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "Prezes zarz\u0105du"}
