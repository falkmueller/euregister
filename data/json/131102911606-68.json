Its vision is to make Europe think young. \n \nOUR HISTORY \n \nIn 2007, as students, we were working in Brussels for one of the biggest European student organisations.\u2028 \nWe often participated in conferences and debates where the only young people involved were the assistants or interns of Members of the European Parliament. \u2028Very few young people were actively involved in the debate regarding the development of Europe, nor were they mentioned as the subjects of studies and research projects that were presented.\u2028Our founders then decided to start an online think-tank where young people were asked, through surveys, what they thought about the future of European integration. They wanted to raise the voice of European youth. \u2028Our first office was opened in September 2009.\u2028Today we have a constantly growing workforce comprised of a diverse mix of cultures and nationalities, spread throughout our two locations in Brussels \u2013 Our Headquarters and our Research Center.\u2028We also have an extensive network of online personnel whom regularly help to advise and contribute to the policies of ThinkYoung.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+32)26088210"}
