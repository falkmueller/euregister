Representing one third of the global membership, this is IUCN\u2019s largest programmatic region. \nEurope is a crucial region for IUCN. Home to the European Union (EU) \u2013 the world\u2019s largest development aid donor \u2013 the region\u2019s influence goes beyond its territorial boundaries. Over the years, the EU has been recognized for its leadership role in international environmental and climate governance. \n \nThe IUCN European Programme provides the framework for IUCN\u2019s action in Europe. It covers the diverse and vast terrestrial and marine European region, including its overseas entities. It strives to shape a sustainable future by helping alleviate biodiversity decline and maintaining and restoring  ecosystem integrity in Europe. Our goals, in line with IUCN Global Programme 2009-2012, are translated into five priority areas: \n\u2022    Conserving biodiversity \n\u2022    Changing the climate forecast \n\u2022    Naturally energizing the future \n\u2022    Managing ecosystems for human well-being \n\u2022    Greening the world economy \nTaking into account the specificity, needs and strengths of the European region, IUCN Secretariat\u2019s work in Europe currently focuses on three areas: Biodiversity, Human Well-being and Green Economy. These goals are pursued through a combination of geographicallybased and thematic-based activities and policy influencing. \nIUCN\u2019s mission is to influence societies to conserve nature. IUCN in Europe has a special role in bringing together a wide range of actors and providing platforms for them to discuss and act on the most pressing issues of our time. Our aim is to connect IUCN Members and their National Committees with other actors in the environmental community and beyond to shape a better future for biodiversity and human beings.", "industry_forums": "", "head_office_phone": "(+32)27393005", "level_of_interest": "European, global, national, regional/local", "relevant_communication": "", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2017", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "1000000-1249999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "1562168", "legal_status": "AISBL", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Anouska Plasmeijer", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "EU Partnerships Officer"}
