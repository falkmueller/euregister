An integrated market will support investment and growth and thus increase the overall competitiveness of the European economy. The EFR therefore strongly encourages national governments and the EU institutions to commit to creating a truly single market for wholesale and retail financial services in Europe. However the integration of financial markets does not stop at the EU\u2019s borders but is increasingly global. EFR Members therefore encourage both national and European leaders to work for internationally consistent financial regulation and supervision and to support and promote free and open markets throughout the world.", "industry_forums": "", "head_office_phone": "(+32)2 256 75 23", "level_of_interest": "European, global, national", "relevant_communication": "", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2017", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "10000-24999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "0", "legal_status": "ASBL (non-profit organisation); registered under Belgium law", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Theo Timmermans", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "Secretary General"}
