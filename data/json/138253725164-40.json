Established to support the UK process manufacturing industry, CPI collaborates with universities, SMEs and large corporates to help overcome innovation challenges and develop next generation products and processes. Operating across a broad range of technologies, we support our partners at every step of the way; from concept to market; business support to technology development; from scale up to supply chain intervention. \n \nCPI supports a sector which currently exports almost \u00a350bn a year with a contribution of over \u00a315bn a year to the UK\u2019s Gross Domestic Product1. CPI leverages its assets, providing significant return on investment which nurtures and supports innovation in this sector. This is imperative if we are to compete in a global market place. However, operating within this innovation space is not without risk, both micro and macro. \n \nAt CPI we understand the risks involved and have developed the CPI Innovation Integrator\u00ae model to support businesses and projects; identifying challenges and opportunities whilst supporting on risk mitigation to prove that new products and processes are viable before moving onto full scale production.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+44)01642455340"}
