MEUZ 2013 was the first MEU held in Croatia and it was the first simulation-based project organized by Croatian Education and Development Network for the Evolution of Communication (HERMES). \n \nAfter MEUZ 2013, there were two more successful editions of this simulation (MEUZ 2014 and MEUZ 2015) and the forthcoming edition MEUZ 2016 will take place in October (2-7 October 2016). \n \nIn general, the participants of the MEU simulations are given an opportunity to grasp the working of the EU institutions in practice, to understand policy challenges and pressing current issues, which the EU is faced with, as well as the underlying principles, standards and values of the EU. The participants develop their skills in EU law and debating and negotiations at the EU level. Through simulating the decision-making process, the participants are learning about it first-hand (\u201clearning by playing\u201d) by defending certain positions and voting on real-life legislative proposals. This method transforms the participants from passive recipients of classroom knowledge into active participants in the educational processes. Additionally, the project produces a multiplier effect on a wider societal scale with participants increasing their involvement in the democratic processes on the European level.", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2017", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "0-9999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "69816", "legal_status": "NGO", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Franjo Jurkin", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "president"}
