The 1st January 2015 the East Sweden Regional Development Council merged with the \u00d6sterg\u00f6tland County Council and formed a new organization called Region \u00d6sterg\u00f6tland and the office in Brussels is a part of this new organization and therefore also changed name to Region \u00d6sterg\u00f6tland EU Office.  \n  \nThe main purpose of the Region \u00d6sterg\u00f6tland EU Office is to be the link between the region and Brussels and a node passing on information of particular interest to its regional partners. The office supports the clients in EU-related issues and provides early warnings on upcoming EU policy developments and funding. The office also works with awareness rising - arranging lectures and study visits. It is also offering advice about projects and encouraging more international contacts. As a part of the support concerning projects, the staff also helps the region in finding possible project partners. Being a regional office in Brussels means being a part of a network with around 250 European regions. As part of this network, the office organise joint events with other European regions to highlight the regions\u2019 common interests in specific issues. Furthermore, it establishes contacts and creates networks between organisations and individuals both in Brussels and in South East Sweden. Finally, the office also helps to market South East Sweden as an attractive partner for cooperation.", "industry_forums": "", "inter_groups": "", "number_of_persons_involved": "4", "relevant_communication": "", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2016", "lat": 50.8402564, "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "0-9999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "253200", "legal_status": "Regional authority", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Madeleine Koskull", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "Head of Office", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+32)483381297"}
