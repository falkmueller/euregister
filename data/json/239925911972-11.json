We have several samples of successful business cases e.g. at chemical industry. Nanotechnology is everywhere, in our clothing, cars, windows, computer and displays, even in our cosmetics and medicine adding new functionalities, intelligence, integrations, portability and networking capability in many new products with high market potential. Nanotechnology is the key to markets worth billions of dollars annually. Nanotechnology helps Europe to address global challenges such as climate change, constraints in energy production and shortage of resources, insufficient access to clean water and food safety, as well as widespread diseases and affordable health care worldwide.
