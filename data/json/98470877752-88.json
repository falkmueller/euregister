AFS traces its roots back to volunteer ambulance drivers who provided their service during the two World Wars; nowadays, AFS is a network of exchange organisations in over 60 countries. With the help of a large network of volunteers they organise short- and long-term intercultural stays abroad (pupil and volunteer service programmes) for over 13,000 young people every year. EFIL supports 30 European AFS organisations by promoting synergies and opportunities in the fields of intercultural learning and global education. \n \nEFIL was established as an international, non-governmental organisation in 1971. Its original purpose was to co-ordinate existing programmes and to establish contacts and programmes in countries not yet involved in the network. Over the past years, EFIL\u2019s scope has become much wider. EFIL is now more than a federation; it\u2019s a partnership, a grouping of organisations committed to stand up for their common interest: providing intercultural learning opportunities to help people develop the knowledge, skills and understanding needed to create a more just and peaceful world.", "industry_forums": "", "head_office_phone": "(+32)02 5145250", "level_of_interest": "European", "relevant_communication": "Newsletter: efilife.eu \n \nBiennial report: https://efil.afs.org/voice/ \n \nAnnual Forum on Intercultural Learning and Exchange https://efil.afs.org/2017/03/29/forum-on-intercultural-learning-and-exchange/ \n \nOngoing campaign 'More funding for pupils' mobility' www.pupilsmobility.eu \nOngoing campaign 'Recognise Study Abroad' www.recognisestudyabroad.eu \n \nSpeaking at events organised by the European Parliament: \n- Debate 'Education in Promoting Intercultural Dialogue and Citizenship\u2019 , 2 December 2015 \n- Interparliamentray meeting, CULT Committee 'Education and Youth', 3 December 2015 \n \nSpeaking at conferences in Brussels during the Lifelong Learning Week: \n- Intercultural and Citizenship education \n- Recognise Study Abroad (hosted at the European Parliament) \n \n \nPilot of the Comenius Individual Pupil Mobility Scheme (2008) \nhttp://ectp.eu/efillife/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Comenius-_pupil_mobility_en.pdf", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2016", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "10000-24999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "516175", "legal_status": "Asbl", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Elisa Briga", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "Programme, Project and Advocacy Coordinator"}
