By bringing together Chief Risk Officers of the various institutions, we are able to identify and benchmark good practice in risk management and share our ideas with the wider industry through publications \u2013 with the goal that these good practices encourage robust risk management within the industry, thereby advancing their business [Core aim #1]. \n \nIn a shifting regulatory landscape, the CRO Forum seeks to promote alignment between regulatory regimes and industry best practice. The CRO Forum supports the development of risk-based regulatory systems which it considers to be in line with best practice risk management within the industry. [Core Aim #2]. \n \nRisk Management is also about looking ahead to risks that could develop, and as such, the CRO Forum runs an Emerging Risk Initiative [Core aim #3].", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+31)0206567547"}
