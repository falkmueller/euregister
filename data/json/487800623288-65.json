Emmaus Europe also aims to act as a liaison and mutual support body for the members of Emmaus in Europe, while respecting their individual characteristics and independence, contribute to and ensure that the work of our members complies with Emmaus International policy and specifically with its fundamental texts and General Assembly decisions.  \nTo this end, Emmaus Europe undertakes the following tasks: lead the region\u2019s member organisations, organise policy-related, economic and social training for Emmaus stakeholders in the region in order to equip them to play their advocacy role at local, national and regional level, gather all the information needed to develop the movement\u2019s campaigning stance so that it can be conveyed to the region\u2019s member organisations and contribute the ideas needed to ensure that the Emmaus International working groups function properly. Emmaus Europe also lobbies the public authorities and European political authorities, forms alliances with other European organisations which share the same aim in order to fight together against extreme poverty and its causes in all parts of the world and particularly in Europe, examines, adopts and monitors regional solidarity initiatives put forward by members of the region.", "industry_forums": "", "head_office_phone": "(+33)141582570", "level_of_interest": "European", "relevant_communication": "Regular meetings with MEPs from different political groups on a range of topics.
