The ambition and goal is to hold governments to account for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, specifically in regards to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). \n \nOur goal and challenge as European Civil Society is to make the Agenda 2030 and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a reality. Making sure we reach all Sustainable Development Goals and targets, within Europe and globally. The SDGs can only be fully achieved with active and broad-based civil society engagement. CSOs will need to advocate for the policies required, raise awareness of goals and targets amongst the general public, monitor progress in implementing the SDGs and push for action where needed (watchdog role). No other actor can combine these different and mutually reinforcing roles as effectively as civil society can. At EU level at present, CSOs need to mobilise for the implementation phase. Organisations that join the process now will ensure that they can shape the new EU level structures that emerge as we begin to work together and with other stake-holders to ensure the implementation of the most ambitious and potentially transformative global agenda ever adopted by the international community. \n \nThe remit of the network is defined and linked to its gaol, the implementation and achievement of the  the Agenda 2030 and the SDGs and all its indicators in a European context. However, this includes decisions that are taken by European actors that concern countries outside of Europe. SDG Watch Europe is a member network based organisations, where in turn all of our members have to be networks themselves working on SDGs and the Agenda 2030 in Europe. \n \nSDG Watch Europe is organised in topical Work Strand where most of the work of the network takes place. Each strand has strand facilitators as detailed on our website. The Work Strands are organised as follows:  \n1. Strand One: Joint high level advocacy and policy coordination for ambitious and integrated EU SDG implementation \n2. Strand Two : Monitoring, accountability and review of European SDG implementation across all sectors \n3. Strand Three: Engaging CSOs and citizens \u2013 at local, national and EU level \n4. Strand Four: Innovating, Reflecting, Experimenting and Learning together \n \nBesides the Annual General Assembly the governance and decision making process is facilitated by the SDG Watch Steering group elected at the Annual General Assembly and consists currently out of 7 members.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+32)22891090"}
