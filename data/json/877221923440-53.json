This College is needed to structure the additional training leading to specialization and to certify its members, and to provide assistance in ESLAV's professional continuing education activities. In other words, the College represents the academic component in our field of laboratory animal medicine. \nRepresentation of the veterinary \"voice\" at regulatory and governmental bodies: \n \nBeyond the internal forum, ESLAV is the only European entity representing the veterinary profession specifically in the laboratory animal medicine field at the European decision making bodies.
