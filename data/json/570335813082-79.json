TAP\u2019s landfall in Italy provides multiple opportunities for further transport of Caspian natural gas to some of the largest European markets such as Germany, France, the UK, Switzerland and Austria. \n \nTAP will promote the economic development and job creation along the pipeline route; it will be a major source of foreign direct investment and it is not dependent on grants or subsidies. With first gas sales to Georgia and Turkey targeted for late 2018, first deliveries to Europe will follow approximately a year later. \n \nTAP\u2019s shareholding is comprised of BP (20%), SOCAR (20%), Snam (20%), Fluxys (19%), Enag\u00e1s (16%) and Axpo (5%). \n \nTAP AG has its headquarters in Baar, Switzerland and offices in Athens, Tirana, Rome, and Lecce. \n \nCurrently, TAP has more than 100 employees and around 25 contractors in the above offices, as well as over 200 experts from contracted service companies. \n \nThe Trans Adriatic Pipeline is recognized as a \u201cProject of Common Interest\u201d and a \u201cProject of Energy Community Interest\u201d.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+41)41 747 3400"}
