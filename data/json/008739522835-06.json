IAPH develops the project of the Environmental Ship Index (ESI). The ESI identifies seagoing ships that perform better in reducing air emissions that required by the IMO. The ESI evaluates the amount of NOx SOx that is released by a ship and includes a reporting scheme on the greenhouse gas emission of the ship. From EU almost all main ports join this system such as Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Hamburg, Antwerp, Bremen/Bremenhaven, Zeebrugge, Le Havre. Apart from EU  Port of Los Angels, Busan Port Authority, Port of Tokyo and Panama Canal Authority are joining this scheme. Those ships who have registed the ESI receive the ESI Score and ships receive some incentives from the ports they call. As of Jul 1 2016 a total 4,295 ships have registed with the ESI.  IAPH believes we are contributing to mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions through this initiative.", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2017", "lat": 35.6534366, "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "10000-24999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "929142", "legal_status": "Non Governmental Organization", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Patrick Verhoeven", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "Managing Director-Policy and Strategy", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+81)354032770"}
