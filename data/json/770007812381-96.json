This helps us all to understand our cultural diversity better and contributes to a thriving knowledge economy. \n \nThe objectives of the Europeana Foundation are  \n\u2022 to make Europe's cultural and scientific heritage available through a cross-domain portal (Europeana.eu) \n\u2022 to work with museums, archives, audio-visual archives and libraries to deliver the portal and make it sustainable \n\u2022 to bring items that have already been digitised into the portal \n\u2022 to encourage and support the digitisation of more of Europe's cultural and scientific heritage \n  \nWe work with a member-network of 800 institutions from every EU member state, who contribute digitised cultural heritage material to Europeana. At present, some 30 million heritage  items can be seen at the website Europeana.eu. The current strategy is to distribute material to social media sites and mobile platforms. To this end, Europeana has developed an API, is collaborating on the development of apps, and is partnering with the Wiki community.", "industry_forums": "", "head_office_phone": "(+070)3140991", "level_of_interest": "European, global", "relevant_communication": "Digital Service Infrastructure under CEF - Europeana DSI \nEuropeana Licensing Framework \nPresidency events with Member States Expert Group for Digitisation in Cultural Heritage \nEuropean Year of Cultural Heritage (2018) projects", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2016", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "50000-99999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "6007254", "legal_status": "non profit organisation", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Jill Cousins", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "Executive Director"}
