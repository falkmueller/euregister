The ETUI places its expertise \u2013 acquired in particular in the context of its links with universities, academic and expert networks \u2013 in the service of workers\u2019 interests at European level and of the strengthening of the social dimension of the European Union.  \n \nThe Institute is composed of two departments: \n \n- A research department with three units:   \n \n\u2022Europeanisation of industrial relations;  \n\u2022Economic, employment and social policies;  \n\u2022Working conditions, health and safety. \n \n- An education department \n \nThe ETUI conducts studies on socio-economic topics and industrial relations and monitors European policy developments of strategic importance for the world of labour. It creates, what is more, bridges between the academic sphere, the world of research and the trade union movement in order to encourage independent research on topics of decisive relevance to the world of labour. \n \nThe ETUI encourages training and learning activities. It provides the ETUC and its affiliates with programmes and exchanges that strengthen the European trade union identity. \n \nThe ETUI provides technical assistance in the field of health and safety with a view to achieving a high level of occupational health and safety protection for workers throughout Europe. \n \nIn the pursuit of its missions, a scientific council composed of twenty-five members, most of them academics, has been set up to contribute to the Institute\u2019s medium-term strategy. A Foresight Studies unit is in charge of studying long-term challenges for the European trade union movement and its implications for the operation of the Institute. \n \nThe ETUI is a non-profit international association under Belgian law, employing a staff of some 70 persons from all over Europe. It receives financial support from the European Union.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+32)22240470"}
