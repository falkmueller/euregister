We communicate our work around the world to increase its reach and impact.  \nWe are independent and trusted: established in 1960, ODI is non-partisan, non-profit and evidence-driven. Our independence is the cornerstone of our credibility. It allows us to develop fresh ideas, challenge orthodoxies and take the risks we need to succeed.  \nAt a time when the world is faced with complex dilemmas, innovation will be essential to finding, testing and scaling bold ideas and solutions. We will be increasingly innovative in the ways in which we bring people together, communicate ideas and increase our influence.  \nWe are a global organisation, with staff, partners and ODI fellows in 50 countries around the world. The changes we seek require local knowledge, new relationships and perspectives, and credibility with decision-makers at both the national and international levels. We will therefore strive to broaden where we work in the world, as well deepen and strengthen our links with who we work with, especially at country level.  \nODI exists to have real impact for those who need it most. This is at the centre of our thinking about what to do, where to go and how we measure our success. \n We are first-class communicators and convenors from our expert commentary to high-profile public and closed-door events, in-depth research reports to top-level media interviews.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+44)2079220300"}
