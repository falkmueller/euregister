It was launched at the Centre for Fine Arts of Brussels in April 2013. Its aim is to stimulate debate and formulate a new perception or \u201cnarrative\u201d of Europe, based upon its cultural values and its unity. Intellectuals and artists are invited to document and formulate a Manifesto for Europe that President Barroso will present to the European Ministers of Culture in spring 2014. \nA \u2018cultural\u2019 committee of some 20 members has been set up at the request of former EC President Barroso and is coordinated by the Director General of the Centre for Fine Arts (CFA), Paul Dujardin. It is the cornerstone of the project. It is composed of cultural personalities, artists, intellectuals and representatives of the civil society.  \nThe CFA holds therefore a very important position in order to help the European Commission to set up this project and its various events. In return, the project puts the CFA in the foreground and provides it with meeting moments with a great number of European artists and intellectuals. \nSeveral official actions and events are planned for this project in several cities, amongst which: \n-Brussels - BOZAR (launching of the project \u2013 23 April 2013), \n-Warsaw in the presence of  Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk (July 2013) \n-Milan in the presence of the Italian Prime Minister (December 2013) \n-Berlin in the presence of the Chancellor Angela Merkel (January 2014) \n \nThis precise project is planned to be continued beyond 2014/15 with the new mandate of the EC up till 2019. \n \nPartners: \n-    European Commission \n-    European Council \n-    National permanent representations in Brussels \n-    Committee of the Regions  \n-    Groupe Spinelli \n \n \nNext to the New Narrative project, the Centre for Fine Arts regularly hosts events organised or co-organised with or by EU institutions.  \n \nThe Centre for Fine Arts is also member of the Cultural Diplomacy Platform of the European External Action Service.", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2016", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "1250000-1499999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "32737956", "legal_status": "Public Law Limited company with social purpose", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Anna VONDRACEK", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "Coordinator Policy Department"}
