We work with clients to move beyond communications to wider planning, to ensure that they prepare for future change before their competitors, and contribute to the policy debate in advance of legislation.  \n \nLobbying:  In general, we work as overall advisors to our clients, engaging other agencies for implementation as needed. In certain cases, however, we also support the advocacy work of our clients directly. Currently lobbying represents less than 10% of our turnover.
