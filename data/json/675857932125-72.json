ADNE has become a recognized interlocutor of the European Union, African Union, African Countries, African Embassies, ACP Group, Governmental agencies and International organizations.  \n \nADNE was created to support African Union (AU) and European Union's efforts to promote the  utilization  of  African Diaspora  expertise  on  economic  development of Africa and Europe. African Union, in its protocol on the amendment to the Constitutive Act of 2003, recognizes the Diaspora as the \u2018sixth region\u2019 of Africa. ADNE strives to mainstream the Diaspora participation in the African Union and EU agenda such as the AU\u2019s Agenda 2063 and Africa-EU Migration, Mobility and Employment (MME) Partnership. \n \nADNE initiated the consultation between the Diaspora and the European institutions including the European Parliament. ADNE is a member of the Policy Forum on Development, a platform bringing together representatives of civil society organizations and local authorities from Europe and partner countries as well as representatives of European institutions and bodies. In partnership with the African Union and the European Union, ADNE initiated the celebration of the Global Diaspora Week  at the European level. \n \nADNE promotes integration of members of African Diaspora in the host countries and provides them with a platform for constructive dialogue, capacity building and knowledge sharing to empower and facilitate their endeavors for sustainable development of Africa. It encourages wider involvement of Africans in shaping the future of Africa and Europe.  \n \nADNE is committed to providing leadership and action on issues of integration and interculturalism, entrepreneurial and investment opportunities, employment, migration, environmental challenges and other pertinent socio-political and economic issues. It will continue to be the conduit for enhancing access of Africans to Political, Economic, Socio-cultural and Technological enablers for sustainable development.  \n \nWithin ADNE, we believe that Africa has a bright and prosperous future which will be propelled by a mutually beneficial partnership with the world; strategic regional integration that is vital to trade and investment - thus unleashing economic growth -, peace and security, democracy, strong, impartial and inclusive institutions that implement ambitious structural reforms to foster wider access to public services and ensure a fair and equitable distribution of the considerable resources of Africa. \n \nADNE is based in Brussels; headquarter of most of European Union institutions. Many international organizations and almost all countries have a diplomatic representation in Brussels. It is the de facto capital of the European Union and Belgium hosts a large number of African Diaspora members. In this respect, Belgium, European Union, African Union Permanent Mission, African Embassies and the ACP Secretariat are strategic partners privileged interlocutors for ADNE. ADNE aims  to build strong partnership with African Union and its Members States, the Regional Economic Communities, European Union and its Member States and other organisations that work on Development  and Economic cooperation.", "industry_forums": "Policy Forum on Development", "head_office_phone": "(+32)0485626057", "level_of_interest": "European, global, national, regional/local", "relevant_communication": "Global Diaspora Week \nEuropean Development Days \nWorkshop \"Workshop on \u201cLeveraging Remittances and Diaspora Contributions towards Sustainable Development of Africa.\u201d  \nStakeholder\u2019s Manifesto: CULTURE; THE LIFEBLOOD OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT \nJoint Declaration of African Diaspora organizations for the Valletta Summit on Migration", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2017", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "2500", "legal_status": "Non-profit", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "MARIE CHANTAL UWITONZE", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "President"}
