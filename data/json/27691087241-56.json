In this sense, it is of particular importance to look at the intersection between research on agriculture, food security and climate change.  To do so, a strong transdisciplinary research base, encompassing economic and social aspects in addition to scientific ones, is required.  This implies the need for cooperative research projects in order to get the necessary expertise for performing the project and delivering maximum impact. The interrelated challenges addressed are European and global and require the effort of multiple actors and stakeholders.  \n \nFor long term sustainability more is needed than just increasing efficiency and productivity. Further developments have to be driven from the demand side and include the urgent need to reduce demand on natural and fossil fuel based resources. \n \nThe expected outcomes of FACCE-JPI include:  \n \n(1)    A large mobilisation of the research community across Europe to work together to meet a grand societal challenge, including innovative solutions.  \n(2)    Knowledge to inform European decision-making \n(3)    Enhanced European visibility and impact in the international context", "industry_forums": "", "head_office_phone": "(+33)1 42 75 92 78", "level_of_interest": "European, global, national", "relevant_communication": "Horizon 2020, Lund Declaration,", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2016", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "100000-199999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "167382", "legal_status": "none", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Isabelle ALBOUY", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "Head of European Affairs"}
