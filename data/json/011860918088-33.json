{"member_organisations": "In the middle eighties different viewer associations appeared in Madrid, Barcelona and another cities, constituting an Iberian federation in 1991. In 2008, they initiated a new brand image for the federation: iCmedia, which is more appropriate to the goals and the new social reality, marked by the development of the information and communications technologies. Nowadays, the Federation is formed by 13 associations which represent tens of thousands of citizens from almost every autonomous community. \nThe members of the associations which constitute the Federation choose in the General Assembly, that is celebrated each year, the members of the iCmedia Directive Committee. The Federation also counts with an Advisory Council constituted by distinguished professionals and Academics from the audiovisual sector. \nhttp://www.icmedianet.org/en/who-we-are/", "identification_number": "011860918088-33", "fields_of_interest": "General and Institutional Affairs, Culture and media, Competition, Consumers, Culture, Education and training, Youth, Single market, Research and innovation, External Relations, Digital economy and society, Borders and Security, Communication", "head_office_address": "C/ Rufino Blanco 8 3B", "full_time_equivalent_fte": "1,5", "person_with_legal_responsibility": "Jose Luis Colas", "industry_forums": "", "grants": "", "inter_groups": "", "eu_initiatives": "Refit DG Connect  \nCULT commission Culture and education \nIntergroup Children\u00b4s rights \nFollow-up Audiovisual Media Service Directive \nOrganisation of International debates chaired by MEP", "level_of_interest": "European, global, national, regional/local", "organisation_name": "iCmedia Federacion de asociaciones de usuarios de medios (iCmedia)", "belgium_office_post_code": "", "number_of_persons_involved": "4", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Paloma  Cantero Gomez", "section": "III - Non-governmental organisations", "source": "", "subsection": "Non-governmental organisations, platforms and networks and similar", "belgium_office_phone": "", "overall_budget_turnover_as_a_range": "", "belgium_office_address": "", "no_geo_reference": true, "persons_accredited_for_access_to_european_parliament_premises": "MORALES#Bego A, PELLICO DEL CASTILLO#Marta Maria", "registration_date": "10/07/2015", "estimate_of_costs_absolute_amount": "", "website_address": "http://www.icmedianet.org", "commission_expert_groups_and_other_similar_entities_european_commission": "NA", "head_office_post_box": "", "head_office_city": "Madrid", "membership": "EIF European Internet Forum \nEurochild \nEuralva", "head_office_post_code": "28028", "position": "Head of International Communications", "financial_year_start_date": "01/01/2017", "head_office_country": "Spain", "number_of_ep_accredited_persons": "2", "relevant_communication": "iCmedia promotes the creation of inner circles between the agents of the audiovisual sector that contribute to raise positives initiatives for everyone related with the audiovisual contents (users, producers, public and private entities and regulators): especially in favour of the childhood and the young people, and the main characters of the sector, with whom iCmedia collaborates in order to support to the daily challenge of improving the quality of the contents. \nSome of the activities we collaborate with are: \nEuropean Day Safe Screens  \nEIF activities \nNET 2020 \nEurodig \nSafer internet \nEurochild", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2017", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "50000-99999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "70481", "legal_status": "Federaci\u00f3n", "procurement": "", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "goals__remit": "iCmedia is the Federation of  Consumers and Media Users Association.
