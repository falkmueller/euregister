Together they represent over 26000 plant researchers and staff. In addition, EPSO has over 3300 personal members. EPSO collaborates with national learned societies active in plant sciences. \n  \nThe mission of EPSO is to promote plant science and plant scientists, to represent plant scientists in discussions about future plant science programme priorities across Europe, to provide an authoritative source of independent information on plant science, and to promote training of plant scientists to meet 21st Century challenges in breeding, agriculture, horticulture, forestry, plant ecology and sectors related to plant science. \n  \nTo achieve its mission, EPSO advises policy and decision makers at national, European and international level on science and science policy (science advice for policy), as an independent body and as member of the Initiative for Science in Europe (ISE) and the Global Plant Council (GPC)and in collaboration with FAO. EPSO supports plant scientists via the EPSO conferences including support grants for junior and eastern scientists, EPSO Young Plant Scientist Awards, workshops, working groups and as information broker via EPSO News, Briefings and its website. EPSO initiated and coordinates the Fascination of Plants Day to foster the dialogue with society at large. \n  \nEPSO\u2019s strategy is defined by the representatives at the General Meeting and further elaborated by the elected Board. The strategy is implemented by the members and staff including various working groups.", "industry_forums": "", "head_office_phone": "(+32)2 213 6260", "level_of_interest": "European, global", "relevant_communication": "", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2017", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "25000-49999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "498375", "legal_status": "Non-profit, academic, international", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Karin Metzlaff", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "Executive Director"}
