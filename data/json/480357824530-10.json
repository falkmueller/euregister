EAST was formed as the European ATM Security Team to act as a cross-border working group, linking security professionals in the ATM industry (and other terminals that have a security impact on the ATM industry) with international law enforcement agencies and prosecutors.  In 2017 EAST changed its name to become the European Association for Secure Transactions.   \n \nOur mission is to gather and provide information to the payments industry and to facilitate effective representation of payment and terminal related security issues at relevant European central institutions, through a pan-European co-ordination of security resources. \n \nEAST has set up a framework network structure to improve co-operation with industry, law enforcement, and in particular Europol, in order to achieve awareness and better results in the fight against organised cross-border crime.
