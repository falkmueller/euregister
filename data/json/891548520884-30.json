Finally, we share field-based analyses on a regular basis with Brussels-based Headquarters and Delegations to inform EU in-country engagement. \n \n- EU support to Security Sector Reform:  \nSaferworld raises awareness about how community security can provide a useful vehicle to support the realisation of EU peacebuilding and statebuilding objectives. Building on our experience, as well as the experiences of others, we are promoting complementary and innovative approaches to security building through bottom up, participatory processes. We are also building on our long standing expertise in security and justice to inform the EU's engagement in Security Sector Reform more broadly, from policy frameworks to in-country programming. \n \n- EU engagement in the 2030 Agenda: \nAt a high-level summit in September 2015, UN member states adopted the new global development framework the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \u2013 previously called the post-2015 Agenda \u2013 which sets out universal goals and targets to guide sustainable development and poverty reduction over the next 15 years. With the agreement on the 2030 Agenda in place, our work is currently focused on ensuring that the inclusion of peaceful and inclusive societies in the 2030 Agenda can be translated into action, including through workshops for EU officials from DEVCO and the EEAS.  \n \n- Arms control within the EU: \nWe are working to strengthen the regulation of the European arms trade by developing policy recommendations to improve the EU Common Position on arms exports and its implementation, as well as by supporting dialogue between EU Member States and civil society. We also run an EU Arms transparency tracker which provides a comparative tool on arms transfer reporting practices in the EU. For more information, see our page on arms transfer controls in Europe. \n \n- Other areas of engagement on an ad hoc basis:  \nSaferworld engages EU institutions on other EU external action topics like Stabilisation and Counter-Terrorism, Migration, and EU engagement in countries and regions where we work (e.g. Yemen, Sudan, South Sudan, Kyrgyzstan, Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Kenya, Somalia, etc.). \n \nhttps://www.saferworld.org.uk/policy-centres/european-union", "level_of_interest": "global", "organisation_name": "Saferworld", "belgium_office_post_code": "1050", "number_of_persons_involved": "1", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Kloe Tricot O'Farrell", "section": "III - Non-governmental organisations", "lon": "-0.0836874", "source": "", "subsection": "Non-governmental organisations, platforms and networks and similar", "belgium_office_phone": "(+32)028930838", "overall_budget_turnover_as_a_range": "", "belgium_office_address": "Rue d'Edimbourg 26", "persons_accredited_for_access_to_european_parliament_premises": "", "registration_date": "03/03/2016", "estimate_of_costs_absolute_amount": "", "website_address": "http://www.saferworld.org.uk/", "commission_expert_groups_and_other_similar_entities_european_commission": "NA", "head_office_post_box": "", "head_office_city": "London", "membership": "Saferworld is a member of: \n \n.
