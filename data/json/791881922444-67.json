By turning ICT e-waste into human and economic resources through the creation of accessible, environmentally sound, socially responsible and sustainable e-waste recycling in developing countries. WorldLoop is an international non-profit organisation whose mantra, \u201cchanging the e-waste cycle,\u201d expresses how the traditional linear flow from product to landfill has been transformed to embrace a circular economy. Literally, WorldLoop is changing the e-waste cycle by organising reverse flows of hazardous e-waste from developing to industrialised countries, for environmentally responsible treatment. A figurative change in the e-waste cycle is the conversion of an environmental threat into a social asset by creating green job opportunities, promoting youth employment and ensuring the environmental sustainability of ICT projects. \nInformation Communication Technologies (ICT) is a social and economic change maker. Developing countries can get access through quality new and reused equipment. It has long been understood that reuse is more sustainable than immediate recycling but sound recycling at the end of the technical lifespan is a crucial factor in the sustainability equation. Developing countries often lack the expertise and infrastructure needed to manage e-waste properly. Polluting primitive recycling processes are often used to get valuable material out while the toxic and non-valuables are left behind, negatively impacting the surrounding communities. Through its network of partners, WorldLoop is working with members of these communities to set-up their own e-waste collection and recycling centres, in turn contributing to the environmentally sound and sustainable use of ICT in developing countries.", "industry_forums": "", "head_office_phone": "(+32)02 614 82 03", "level_of_interest": "global", "relevant_communication": "WorldLoop, as part of a consortium led by the Italian take-back scheme Remedia, has been involved in the EU Horizon 2020 funded project - Developing an e-waste implementation toolkit to support the recycling and the secondary raw material recovery strategies in metropolitan areas in Africa (EWIT) since March of 2015. The consortium, made up of a multi-stakeholder group from academia, NGOs and local authorities (municipalities) have been tasked with developing an e-waste implementation toolkit to support the recycling and the secondary raw material recovery strategies in metropolitan areas in Africa.  \nThe project consists of: \n8 twin-city workshops (Choma-Vienna; Kisii County-Porto; Johannesburg-Florence; Abidjan-Antwerp) resulting in 4 unique e-waste management system master plans; \n4 expert modelling workshops (Collection, Technology, Closed-loop modeling, and  Finance & Legislation) resulting in 4 unique operating guidelines with specific recommendations for each African municipality as well as common challenges and solutions applicable to other municipalities interested in setting up a local e-waste management system with circular economic ambitions; Development of an online e-waste implementation toolkit and knowledge base; Dissemination of the results. \nExperts across academia, civil-society organizations, the private sector including formal and informal collectors, dismantlers and recyclers as well as producers, as well as urban authorities (municipalities) have contributed to the outcomes of the workshops as well as the final deliverables. \nAfter 4 years of supporting sustainable reuse and recycling of e-waste initiatives in sub-Saharan Africa, and through its activities of operationalizing the UN Step model of \u201cBest-of-2-Worlds\u201d, WorldLoop has become proficient in supporting the efforts to bring circular economic solutions to Africa and this expertise was leveraged for EWIT\u2019s Expert Modelling Workshop \u2013 Closing the Loop. \nThe Closing the Loop workshop took place in December 2015, at Mintek in Johannesburg, South Africa. As the scope of the EWIT project is limited to e-waste management implementation, the focus of this workshop was on implementable improvements for the e-waste value chain within each municipality although consideration was also given to additional principles of responsible importation, product life/eco-design and upcycling. \nDrawing from the base line scenarios in each of the 4 African cities/counties (data gathered during the Twin City Workshops and the coinciding Master Plans) the viability of closed loop options, with a specific focus on environmental protection and economy in the region, for the following component and fraction streams were analyzed: \nNon-ferrous metals \n-    Ferrous metals \n-    Printed circuit boards \nHi-tech plastics \n-    Brominated flame-retardant plastics \n-    CRT & Flat panel monitors \n-    Portable batteries \n-    Rare-earth elements \nPrinter cartridges & toners \n-    Refrigerator foam \n-    Florescent tubes \n \nAs a result of this two-day workshop, Closed-Loop Operating Guidelines have been drafted, providing specific recommendations per municipality to develop an e-waste management system inclusive of circular economic principles as well as common challenges and solutions to improve the e-waste value chain starting with collection, continuing with good reuse, parts harvesting and eventually resource extraction and how to connect, according to a \u201ccircular economy\u201d \u2013symbiotic vision, to selected end user industries that will benefit for the availability of secondary raw materials. An emphasis was placed on solutions within the local economies. \nThe project will end with a toolkit developed on the back of the 8 twin-city workshops focusing on knowledge exchange between cities, and four expert modeling workshops on topics such as financing, legislation, and closed-loop modelling.
