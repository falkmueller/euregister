We promote environmental integrity and human rights and empower communities to participate in decision making processes related to climate policies. \n \nOur values \n \nClimate policies need to hold polluters accountable for their actions. To that end, we believe that robust democratic processes are imperative to result in fair and effective climate policy. Moreover, climate measures need to be implemented in line with universal human rights in order to work for people and the environment.  \n \nOur work \n \n\u2022    Carbon Market Watch advocates for policy solutions that promote sustainable development, environmental integrity, and good governance. We work at national, regional and international levels to ensure that these concerns remain at the heart of policymaking. \n\u2022    We provide decision makers with fact-based analysis of the issues we cover and, through targeted outreach and training, give a voice to communities to participate in decision making processes.  \n \nMore information is available at http://carbonmarketwatch.org/about/", "industry_forums": "", "head_office_phone": "(+43)67761169417", "level_of_interest": "European, global, national, regional/local", "relevant_communication": "Events:  \n- UNFCCC Side Event: Protecting human rights in international carbon markets, Bonn, 01/05/2018 \n- UNFCCC Side Event \u2013 Ships, Planes and Paris: Clearly navigating to 1.5\u00b0C, COP23, Bonn, 15/11/2017 \n-  Carbon pricing: Yes.
