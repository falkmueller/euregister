It starts with the obvious generous act of taking one or two elderly or less-abled people out on a bike ride. It\u2019s a simple act that everyone can do. \n \nSlowness: Slowness allows you to sense the environment, be present in the moment and it allows people you meet along the way to be curious and gain knowledge about Cycling Without Age because you make time to stop and talk. \n \nStorytelling: Elderly people have so many stories that will be forgotten if we don\u2019t reach out and listen to them. We tell stories, we listen to stories on the bike and we also document the stories when we share them via word of mouth or on social media. \n \nRelationships: Cycling Without Age is about creating a multitude of new relationships: between generations, among the elderly, between pilots and passengers, nursing homes employees and family members. Relationships build trust, happiness and quality of life. \n \nWithout Age: Life does not end when you turn 75. Life unfolds at all ages, young and old, and can be thrilling, fun, sad, beautiful and meaningful. Cycling Without Age is about letting people age in a positive context \u2013 fully aware of the opportunities that lie ahead when interacting in their local community. \n \nHow It Works \nVolunteers (pilots) sign up for bike rides with the elderly as often or as rarely as they want to. It\u2019s all driven by people\u2019s own motivation. At present (February 2018) more than 1,100 chapter locations around the world offer Cycling Without Age from well over 1,500 trishaws \u2013 and the numbers are still growing. More than 10,000 pilots ensure that the elderly get out of their nursing homes, out on the bikes to enjoy the fresh air and the community around them. They give them the right to wind in their hair.", "industry_forums": "", "inter_groups": "", "number_of_persons_involved": "1", "relevant_communication": "Meetings with high level EU officials", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2017", "lat": 55.7093717, "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "0-9999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "181142", "legal_status": "Association", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Ole Kassow", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "Founder", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+45)53621979"}
