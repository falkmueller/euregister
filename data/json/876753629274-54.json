The core of this group is composed of pioneers, media organisations (publishers and suppliers), and academic research labs dealing with technology transfer and research programmes in Europe (Norway, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, UK), the Americas (Brazil, USA, Canada), and Southeast Asia (Singapore, Japan). \n \nThe Alliance was formed because its members all believe that our industry requires a reliable flood of new technologies, products and business models. We see the future of news media being invented right now, all around the globe, by hundreds of different companies, universities and entrepreneurs. But their separate efforts, research, prototypes and rollouts receive inconsistent attention and analysis. Many good ideas fail simply due to a lack of development support, while others get hyped beyond their real value. Vital lessons and examples are not being widely enough or rapidly enough disseminated. \n \nGAMI focuses on five main topic areas relevant to the future of news media companies, news professionals, and news consumers: \n \nNew platforms/distribution channels: mobility, wear-ability, the Internet of Things (smart cities, connected homes, connected cars, connected devices); \nNew forms of narrative and storytelling: immersive content, VR, 360\u00b0 video, social media; \nData exploration: big data, data visualisation, automatic generation of content; \nTechnology enablers: privacy, security; \nMultiple media convergence: interoperability, standards (IPTC, etc.) \nGAMI is guided by an Advisory Board representing news media or media labs, suppliers, research centres, universities, technology clusters and accelerators. \n \n \n \nhttps://media-innovation.news/", "head_office_post_code": "75010", "position": "CEO", "financial_year_start_date": "01/01/2017", "head_office_country": "France", "number_of_ep_accredited_persons": "", "relevant_communication": "", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2017", "lat": "48.8757244", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "200000-299999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "0", "legal_status": "Association", "procurement": "0", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "goals__remit": "The World Association of Newspapers and News Publishers, or WAN-IFRA, is the global organisation of the world\u2019s press.
