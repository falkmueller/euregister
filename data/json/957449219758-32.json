It has been formed after wide consultation and engagement of many stakeholders to fill a recognised gap, to develop products and services that can help to maximise the value obtained by all stakeholders from health data, to support innovations in health maintenance, health care delivery and in knowledge discovery. It will importantly bring multiple stakeholder groups together in order to ensure that future solutions serve their collective needs and can be readily adopted affordably and at scale. \n \ni~HD has been established as a European not for profit body, registered in Belgium through Royal Assent.
