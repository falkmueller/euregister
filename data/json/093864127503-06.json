The objective is to secure food production for the increasing worldwide population while developing sustainable production methodologies to fight pests with an Integrated Pest Management approach (IPM), to be used in the European and Chinese agriculture. EUCLID research activity aims at developing more sustainable pest management methods in Europe and China in order to reduce the negative effects of pesticides on human health and the environment, to reduce economic losses in agriculture, and to provide scientific support to EU and China policies. Years: 2015-2019 \n \n- Peripheral Access: Transnational cooperation and partnership for better public transport in peripheral and cross-border regions (2017/2019) \nIt is a project cofinanced by Central Europe Program. Peripheral Access improves mobility in specifically peripheral areas such as rural, remotely located or border regions. This is crucial as 93% of the EU territories are peripheral areas. The project will analyse this situation in detail and implement innovative pilot actions. \n \n- Novelog: New Cooperative Business Model and Guidance for Sustainable City Logistics (2015/2018)  \nIt is a project cofinanced by H2020 Programme. The scope of the project is to enable the knowledge and understanding of freight distribution and service trips by providing guidance for implementing effective and sustainable policies and measures.

VIU thereby contributes to and is an integral part of the internationalisation strategies of the member organisations. \n \nRole of universities today \nUniversities today must play a strategic role in addressing the new global challenges: sustainable development, climate change and energy, food and water security, urban growth, welfare, ageing populations, the widening gap between rich and poor, global ethics, protection of tangible and intangible cultural heritage, human rights, equality, democratization, peace and conflict, global governance, cyber-security.  Some of these critical global issues can be predicted, others arise unexpectedly and suddenly, and traditional training is not necessarily the best way to find solutions. Today's students need to develop different skills, must be able to work across disciplines, to react with great flexibility and a broad intellectual range. \n \nCommon campus  \nThe common campus in Venice creates a sense of community that favors consensus building. Programs are drawn up collegially together, across disciplines, continents, languages and cultures. Students encounter a truly intercultural experience at VIU. \n \nVenice \nOne of the advantages is to be in Venice, a living laboratory in a fragile environment with a remarkable cultural heritage where students and professors can directly experience and become aware of some of the common challenges.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+39)0412719511"}
