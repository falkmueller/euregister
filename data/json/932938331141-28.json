EHRA is supporting advocacy of its members on national level and supporting Civil Society Forum on Drugs work on EU level. \n3.

EHRA operates in accordance with the Articles of Association adopted by EHRA\u2019s General Assembly. By  1st of April 2018, EHRA unites 214 organizational and individual members from 28 countries of CEECA.  \nAll the programs and activities are consistent with EHRA Strategic Framework 2018-2019 which was approved by The General Assembly of EHRA in 2017. \nEHRA is acting as strategic partner and fiduciary agent of Eurasian Network of People Using Drugs (ENPUD). \nEHRA mission is to create favourable environment for sustainable harm reduction programs and for decent lives of people who use drugs in CEECA region. EHRA vision is a society where human rights are safeguarded for every individual. We strive for a strong community of people who use drugs supported by civil society to achieve a progressive human rights-based drug policy, sustainable funding and efficiency of harm reduction services based on needs of people who use drugs. \nOur role is to bring in international resources and knowledge, equip CEECA region with expertise and effective practices; we set the regional and national agenda of drug policy and harm reduction with the meaningful involvement of drug users community in national and local stakeholders dialogue. \nStrategic objective 1: To ensure sustainability and efficiency of harm reduction services in CEECA region. \nProvision of sustainability of harm reduction programs by municipal governments focused on technical support to civil society and community representatives and organizations as well as their meaningful involvement in the municipal, national, regional and global level transition- focused advocacy and decision-making processes, is crucial to insure sustainability and efficiency of HIV prevention and other priority services. Communities should become one of key actors in the process of effective transition from international support to domestic funding. \nStrategic objective 2: To advocate for non-punitive drug policies in CEECA region based on public health and human rights. \nRepresenting different political, cultural and socio-economist contexts, CEECA countries continue to apply prohibition approach and punitive sanctions for drug possession for personal use. The region will go a long way to reorient its drug policies to humanistic and right-based approach. There are significant differences in factors that explain extremely high stigma around drug-related issues, low access to and limited efficiency in using human rights instruments. In this context, the central role in documenting human rights violation and analyzing them through the prism of international and national legislation has to be given to people who use drugs, their \u2018traditional allies\u2019 \u2013 harm reduction programs, and any human rights movements, organizations and other partners, who can help in documenting human rights violations and advocate for non-punitive drug-policies. \nStrategic objective 3: To develop leadership and expertise of civil society and people who use drugs in monitoring of drug policies, financing, access and quality of harm reduction services in CEECA region.  \nStrategic objective 4: To strengthen organizational governance and operational systems, program efficiency and financial sustainability of EHRA.", "industry_forums": "", "head_office_phone": "(+370)62010630", "level_of_interest": "European", "relevant_communication": "EHRA is implementing several regional advocacy projects which partly addressing EU members states and neighbour countries in Central and Eastern Europe and Cetral Asia countries including following: \n-    Project \u201cAdvocacy for access, sustainability, and quality of harm reduction services and for protection of human rights for people who use drugs in Eastern Europe and Central Asia in Central and Eastern Europe and Central Asia countries \n-    Project Regional Civil Society and Community Support, Communication and Coordination Platform in Eastern Europe and Central Asia (Regional Platform EECA) supported The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GF)    Project Period: December 2017- April 2020 Target Countries: Eastern Europe and Central Asia countries \n-    Right to Life supported by Levi Strauss Foundation in Estonia, Russia \n-    Money Can Buy Health If You Budget For It implemented by Eurasian Regional Consortium supported by Robert Carr Civil Society Networks Fund (RCNF).
