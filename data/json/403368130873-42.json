Among the specific objectives of our activity are the support, development, and consolidation of mechanisms of transitional justice in countries emerging from armed conflicts, the support of the role of civil society in these processes, and the search of the reconciliation of the society and the victims through finding the truth and achieving the confidence in the processes. We firmly believe that 3 principles are necessary for building a sustainable peace: Justice should be based on the truth, society as a whole must look for peace and security, and those two are based on the developing of democracy and equitable development.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+39)3393139"}
