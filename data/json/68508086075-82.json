La Gomera, the non-profit association M.E.E.R. wants to guarantee that the encounter between humans and cetaceans happens with respect and consideration. This is realised through the combination of ecological whale watching tourism, scientific research and public education.  \n \nOur studies underline the uniqueness of La Gomera\u2019s waters. From our research results we are able to develop recommended procedures for the protection of the seas. We regularly present our research results in scientific journals, at conferences and workshops, etc..   \n  \n \nIn 2001, the project M.E.E.R. La Gomera was honoured with the International Environmental Award \u201cTourism and Environment\u201d which is granted by the German Association of Travel Agencies and Travel Operators (DRV).   \n \nOur goals are: \n \n- Establishment of a marine protected area off La Gomera  \n- Restriction of fast ferries in waters with a high abundance of cetaceans  \n- Far-sighted regulation of the whale watching-tourism  \n- Sustainability as a general principle for all uses of La Gomera\u2019s waters.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+49)30 64497230"}
