It pursues these goals by sharing best practices of successful democracies, identifying challenges to democracy in nascent democracies, and expressing solidarity with fellow members of parliament and democracy advocates in non-democracies. The PFD welcomes democratically elected parliamentarians, and other former democratically elected politicians who stand in opposition to less democratic or authoritarian governments in their own countries, however only parliamentarians from countries in the Community of Democracies can be members of the Governing Council of the PFD. \n \n \nThe PFD is an organization whose members will not compromise in their commitment to promoting democracy wherever it is lacking or threatened.
