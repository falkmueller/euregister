The use of different techniques and tools is a common practice to cover all stages in the system development lifecycle of an industry, generating a very good number of variable registries. Moreover, these registries are commonly encoded in different formats and can only be accessed, in most cases, through proprietary and non-standard protocols. \n \nIMOLA created a standard for that: the European Land Registry Document (ELRD)  formulates reference information within a structure of common fields (Template), developed through an XSD / XML scheme that allows semi-automatic processing of information through shared rules with metadata derived from a thesaurus. The next step is to deal with  the interoperability problem among partners. This scenario can be considered a real nightmare for information reuse and, more specifically, IMOLA II will allow us to take advantage of the implicit knowledge encoded in the different registries. \n \nWith this project ELRA contributes to the achievement of the objectives of the European e-Justice Strategy specified in the Multiannual Action Plan 2014-2018. \n \nThe main aim of IMOLA II, as a follow-up project, is to provide an interoperability platform among Land Registers in Europe. Controlled vocabularies are essential elements for the IMOLA II project a starting point for achieving the semantic shared repository, (Knowledge Repository). \n \nELRA is awarded by the Framework Partnership Agreement 2018-2021 JCOO- Judicial cooperation.", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2017", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "100000-199999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "326320", "legal_status": "NGO", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Jan Moerkerke", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "President"}
