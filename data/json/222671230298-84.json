Founded in 1923 by Richard Coudenhove-Kalergi, and presided by him until 1972, it encourages peace, human rights and democracy by promoting, fostering and spreading the idea of European unification and European patriotism as the crowning achievement of the national identities. The next president was Dr Otto von Habsburg, who was in charge from 1973 to 2004. Since 2004 the president has been Alain Terrenoire. \n \n   The IPEU has its headquarters in Strasbourg and member organisations in 28 countries. It is committed to the free, self-dependent development of the person, the strengthening of the family and other natural communities, as well as to a Europe that is characterised by social justice and the principles of solidarity and subsidiarity. \n \n  The activities of the IPEU include organising international conferences, round tables, seminars, exhibitions, site visits,publishing, education etc.  It functions as a critical think-tank focusing on past, present, and future European affairs. \n \n  The International Paneuropean Union is a paragon of promoting common European values, traditions, fundamental principles, perspectives and integration. With almost a century of experience in constant consideration and re-consideration of Europe's future, even during its darkest times in history under the reign of fascism and communism, IPEU of today continues to challenge contemporary and on-going crisis and obstacles in the path of fulfillment of its vision of Europe-to-be. \n \n   To establish and, even more importantly, to maintain a Europe of lasting peace and freedom, the ultimate goal for IPEU, is to have a Europe that is integrated, ruled by law and based on solidarity and subsidiarity. Even though the creation of European Union was a giant leap in that direction, there is still and always will be much more to do. \n \nTherefore, IPEU as an NGO exists and participates in almost every European country and on different levels, giving the impetus for the respective citizens in developing the common European identity, raising the democratic standards, promoting the rule of law, raising the awareness of common values and importance of peace, encouraging intercultural dialogue and mutual understanding, while providing them with a platform for active democratic participation and engagement, as well as passive information source on European and EU issues. \n \n   The Paneuropean Union supports the further development of the European Union, including the areas of security and defence, making it a fully effective political unit, both outwards and inwards. The European continent is called upon to defend the ideals of freedom and human dignity in the world.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+33)6899738403"}
