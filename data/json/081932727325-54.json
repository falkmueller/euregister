The goal is achievable through the application of a newly developed 100% biobased and biodegradable multi-component material developed by Polymer Institute of the Slovak Academy of Sciences and Slovak University of Technology with collaboration of Panara company, which has obtained exclusive licence for blend production for European area, Russia, Singapore, China.
