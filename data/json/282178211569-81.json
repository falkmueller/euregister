The use of renewable resources is not only a big topic in Germany, but more or less worldwide. Many other countries are quite active in this area, since there is a global need to use resources in a more sustainable way. In order to accelerate this development, coordination of respective efforts play an important role for using synergies and avoiding overlaps across national boundaries. FNR aims to contribute to the needed coordination and knowledge transfer and has actively been participating in various trans-national projects and international cooperations for several years.", "industry_forums": "", "inter_groups": "", "number_of_persons_involved": "17", "relevant_communication": "Events \nhttp://www.fnr.de/service/veranstaltungen/ \nPublications \nhttps://mediathek.fnr.de/", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2016", "lat": 53.8210452, "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "10000-24999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "3205653", "legal_status": "Registered association", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Birger Kerckow", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "Head of Department", "belgium_office_city": "Brussels", "head_office_phone": "(+49)38436930100"}
