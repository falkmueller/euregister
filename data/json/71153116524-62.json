It is an umbrella organization of interest groups that represent Austrian, Bavarian, Hessian and South Tyrolean medium-sized energy companies. EVME combines the interests of these companies and operates throughout Europe. \n \nThis newly founded association understands itself as an interest group that operates in addition to the traditional interest groups. Its goal is to represent medium-sized energy companies in Brussels. \n \nThe constitution of a European association was necessary as it became obvious that Brussels was not sufficiently informed about the excellent services which medium-sized energy companies provide in their local communities. Especially medium-sized companies most often satisfy their customers in terms of efficiency, reliability and service. Furthermore, they are locally rooted important regional employers, and they heavily contribute to regional value creation.", "industry_forums": "", "head_office_phone": "(+43316)6857870", "level_of_interest": "European, national, regional/local", "relevant_communication": "Stelltungnahmen zu energierechtlichen Fragen und Konsultationen, Veranstaltungen, pers\u00f6nliche Gespr\u00e4che", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2016", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "0-9999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "0", "legal_status": "Verein", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Roland TROPPER", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "Mitglied des Vorstandes, Gesch\u00e4ftsf\u00fchrer"}
