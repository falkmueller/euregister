Action is needed now to enable Europe to retain its leading technological and industrial position in the field of civil nuclear technology. \n \nTo achieve this goal, a shared Vision Report (download report here) of stakeholders, published end of 2007 during the first General Assembly, offers a vision for the development of nuclear fission energy technologies, with the aim of: \n \n- achieving a sustainable production of energy \n- achieving significant progress in economic performance \n- improving the efficiency in the utilisation of natural resources \n- cogenerating electricity and process heat \n- continuously improving safety levels \n- minimising waste and resistance to proliferation", "level_of_interest": "European", "organisation_name": "Sustainable Nuclear Energy Technology Platform (SNETP)", "belgium_office_post_code": "", "procurement": "", "section": "IV - Think tanks, research and academic institutions", "lon": 2.385813, "source": "", "belgium_office_address": "", "belgium_office_phone": "", "number_of_ep_accredited_persons": "", "overall_budget_turnover_as_a_range": "", "subsection": "Think tanks and research institutions", "no_geo_reference": true, "persons_accredited_for_access_to_european_parliament_premises": "", "estimate_of_costs_absolute_amount": "", "registration_date": "12/01/2017", "website_address": "http://www.snetp.eu", "commission_expert_groups_and_other_similar_entities_european_commission": "NA", "head_office_post_box": "", "head_office_city": "Paris", "membership": "NUGENIA Association - www.nugenia.org  \n \nESNII - http://www.snetp.eu/esnii/  \n \nNC2I - http://www.snetp.eu/nc2i/", "head_office_post_code": "75011", "goals__remit": "SNETP is an instrument for the attaining the SET plan goals, leading to the long-term establishment of sustainable energy production towards the transition to a low-carbon energy mix. \n \nSNETP ensures enhanced coordination between national programmes while guaranteeing the most effective use of programme funding.
