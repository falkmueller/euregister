This conversion process, the customization of the products and the development and provision of services is characterized by addition of value for users/customers in the chain between data collection and exploitation of information. The development of EO technology from space and the continuous growth of a wide diversity of applications have created the basis of a new emerging service industry worldwide covering activities in value adding and the development of market segments in response to user needs. \n \nSince 1989, EARSC has provided its Members technical expertise and policy guidance, and has contributed to establish industry contact with European institutional bodies. In these times of intensified European integration and co-operation, the role of EARSC is becoming increasingly vital. Nowadays we would like to bring the specialized knowledge of EARSC\u2019s members to bear on current European issues. That is for, the Association maintains close links with key European Institutions, including EC-DG GROW, DG RTD, DG Connect, EEA, ESA and National Space Agencies, providing a key unified voice on wider European issues.", "industry_forums": "", "head_office_phone": "(+32476)737564", "level_of_interest": "European", "relevant_communication": "Our position papers can be found here: http://earsc.org/library/", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2015", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "500000-599999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "0", "legal_status": "a.i.s.b.l.", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Ariane DUBOST", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "Project Officer"}
