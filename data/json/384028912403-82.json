Our vision is a Europe where where every person can freely live according to their gender identity or expression without interference. In European societies people are exclusively perceived as either men or women. People whose gender identity or gender expression differs from these socially accepted norms fall between the cracks. Trans people either permanently or during transition challenge these norms. As a result they may face ridicule, discrimination, unemployment, social exclusion and violence at the hands of individuals or institutions. TGEU was founded as a response, to strengthen the trans movement and to provide a consistent voice at European level.
