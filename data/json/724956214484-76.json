They offer huge energy-saving potential through investment of around EUR 60 billion per year \u2013 a major source of economic activity. \nInvestment in new commercial property buildings and the refurbishment and development of existing buildings on average totals nearly EUR 252 billion each year \u2013 with infrastructure and housing, this represents 62% of all capital investment in the EU.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+32)022138160"}
