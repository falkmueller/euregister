It brings people together in a powerful worldwide coalition to end the devastating impact of corruption on men, women and children around the world. \nOur vision is a world in which government, politics, business, civil society and the daily lives of people are free of corruption. \nSince its founding in 1993, TI has played a lead role in improving the lives of millions around the world by building momentum for the anti-corruption movement. TI raises awareness and diminishes apathy and tolerance of corruption, and devises and implements practical actions to address it. \nTransparency International is a global, politically non-partisan network including more than 100 locally established national chapters and chapters-in-formation. These bodies fight corruption in the national arena in a number of ways. They bring together relevant players from government, civil society, business and the media to promote transparency in elections, in public administration, in procurement and in business. TI\u2019s global network of chapters and contacts also use advocacy campaigns to influence governments to implement anti-corruption reforms. \nIn addition to the national chapters, Transparency International has an International Secretariat (TI-S) in Berlin. The International Secretariat is an independent association (\u201ceingetragener Verein\u201d) established under German law. The secretariat provides leadership for the movement\u2019s international initiatives, supports chapters and coordinates our regional work through knowledge sharing, advocacy and coalition building. \nIn collaboration with national chapters, the secretariat produces numerous research, tools and policy positions. It serves as a knowledge centre, offering valuable insights into the dynamics of corruption and new approaches to tackling it. \nTransparency International\u2019s relations with the EU Institutions are coordinated by Transparency International EU (the Brussels office of the organisation). TI-EU is an independent AISBL established under Belgian law. It is the mission of TI EU to prevent corruption and promote integrity, transparency and accountability in EU institutions, policies and legislation. It is its objective to create lasting, structural change at the EU level so that government, politics, business, civil society and the daily lives of people are characterized by integrity, justice and security. \nTI EU works in close cooperation with the TI Secretariat in Berlin and TI national chapters particularly with those 24 chapters located in EU member states. The objective of TI EU is to fulfill the European dimension of the global TI movement \u2013 to provide Brussels-based advocacy at the EU level.  \nBy its very nature, corruption is a crosscutting issue that negatively affects citizens. The many facets of corruption exacerbate the exploitation of the poor and underprivileged, and can have serious implications on the right to equality before law, the right to property, the freedom to perform business, fair and just working conditions, fair political representation and participation, and the basic rights to dignity, integrity and personal security. To alleviate these problems, TI EU works to fight corruption and to create an EU in which all citizens can exercise their fundamental rights in full. \nIn addition to that, EU legislation and policies can have significant impact on the fight against corruption at national level in EU member states and beyond. The work at EU level thus contributes to the fight against corruption in many countries around the world, for example through work on anti-money laundering regulation, development aid, structural funds and by ensuring that the EU Institutions themselves lead by example when it comes to transparency and the prevention of corruption.", "belgium_office_city": "Brussels", "head_office_phone": "(+49)303438200"}
