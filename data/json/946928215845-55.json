All mobile operators in Finland abide by strict net neutrality principles: operators do not apply vertical price-discriminations. Despite the mass-affordable open mobile internet offers and very heavy mobile data traffic the Finnish telecom sector generates healthy returns for its investors (16% ROCE for the market leader operator). \nINDEPENDENCE AND INTEGRITY \nRewheel is fully independent from dominant telecom companies, equipment vendors and their industry lobby organisations such as GSMA, ETNO or ECTA.  \n \nOur independence and integrity is demonstrated by the strong and straightforward, pro-competition public positions taken in top business media such as the Financial Times, Reuters, Bloomberg, European Voice or the Wall Street Journal. We are often quoted on the hottest industry topics - in 2014 it is whether telecom and competition regulators should allow in-market consolidations leading to higher operator profits or the opposite: promote stronger infrastructure and spectrum based competition, leading to faster networks and more affordable mobile connectivity prices for consumers and higher utilisation of scarce spectrum resources.  \n \nOur consulting firm's small size and financial independence allows us to be selective on our engagements. If a client's objectives are in conflict with our general pro-competitive stand point, we do not undertake the project. \nONLY SENIOR CONSULTANTS \nRewheel is privately owned by its founders Antonios Drossos (managing partner, Linkedin profile) and P\u00e1l Zar\u00e1ndy (senior partner, Linkedin profile).  \n \nMonitoring mobile internet access competitiveness in Europe and OECD countries", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+358)442032339"}
