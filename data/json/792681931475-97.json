The FIDO Alliance is changing the nature of authentication by developing specifications that define an open, scalable, interoperable set of mechanisms that supplant reliance on passwords to securely authenticate users of online services. This new standard for security devices and browser plugins allows any website or cloud application to interface with a broad variety of existing and future FIDO Certified devices that users can leverage for enhanced online security.", "industry_forums": "", "inter_groups": "", "number_of_persons_involved": "1", "relevant_communication": "", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2017", "lat": 42.5238036, "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "50000-99999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "0", "legal_status": "Non-profit standards development organization", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Brett McDowell", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "Executive Director", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+1)4086573436"}
