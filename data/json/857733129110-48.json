In Antwerp there is just a representative office with no power and no employers. Studio Coggiola is an Italian a tax and legal office where entrepreneurs can find both specialist advice from Italian law and specialist advice from European Union law. In the current circular economy era, for the company manager it's important to have a global wiew to make reasoned choices in business management. For that reason Studio Coggiola can advise the manager not only over the accounting aspects but also on the European vision of their business. With all of this in mind, a particular focus is on start-up companies, to take them to the mature phase in order to grow up business and employment. Another very important focus is the internalization of trade and supranational corporations.
