DOPPS differs strongly from other NGOs in Slovenia in human resources: most of the projects are led by the office with 24 full-time employees, while our strenght in research, monitoring and education work lies in app. 300  active volunteers. No other conservation NGO in Slovenia has such manpower, neither in volunteer nor in professional part. \n \n5.    Periodicals.

DOPPS was the first organisation in Slovenia ever awarded with the management licence over a protected area, which sets a valuable precendent. This is the 10-years management licence over the Nature reserve \u0160kocjanski zatok, awarded by the Government in 1999 and later prolonged to 2019. Up to now we remain the only NGO  in Slovenia having such a management licence. Apart from the \u0160kocjanski zatok we managed to establish the second nature reserve called I\u0161ki morost in the Ljubljansko barje landscape park and Natura 2000 area. In 2010 DOPPS started with establishment of the third nature reserve called Ormoske lagune in the NE Slovenia in the Natura 2000 area Drava. \n \n8.    EU projects.
