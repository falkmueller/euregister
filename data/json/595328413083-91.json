Through its 60 members from 30 countries, health coverage is provided to some 240 million people in the world and around 200 million in Europe through compulsory and/or complementary health insurance and managing health and social facilities. \n \nObjectives and Mission \n \nAIM strives to defend the access to healthcare for all through solidarity-based and non-for profit health insurance. \nAIM\u2019s mission is to provide a platform for members to exchange common issues and to represent their interests and values in the European and international Institutions. \n \nValues \nThe AIM was founded in 1950 based on mutuals\u2019 values which are: \n \nSolidarity \nNot-for-profit orientation \nUniversal Access to healthcare \n \nMutuals and health protection organisations believe that health is not a good like others and that people should be at the center of the healthcare system. These values are rooted in the origin of the mutualist movement in the 19th century where people chose to go together and create health funds for their own protection. Nowadays mutual societies in Europe and some other mutual societies in the world fight to preserve these ideas also embodied in health protection bodies. \n \nChallenges \n \nToday AIM reaffirms the validity of its values in front of challenges such as ageing of the population, the prevalence of chronic diseases, rising healthcare expenditure and changes in lifestyles. \n \nAIM members engage for: \n \nCost-efficient and affordable health systems, \nStrengthened health mutual benefit societies,recognized as such for their value in social economy,  \nHealth protection for all without inequalities", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+32)2 234 57 00"}
