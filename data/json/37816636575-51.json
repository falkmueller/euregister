Our approach will be to engage constructively with policy makers but to challenge forcefully the current status quo that continues to see our technologies and ideas left on the shelf rather than deployed to the benefit of Europe. \n \nThe European Alliance to Save Energy will make this happen by: \n\u2022 Giving energy efficiency a stronger voice: Senior business leaders from the energy efficiency industry have not done enough to ensure that their voice is heard; the Alliance creates a platform from which they can put this right and join with politicians and thought leaders to ensure our voice is heard \n  \n\u2022 Giving energy efficiency a broader voice: The Alliance offers a platform for all energy efficiency industry and supporters alike \n  \n\u2022 Giving policy makers a port of call on big issues: A number of high level policies can be supported by energy efficiency; the Alliance will offer policy makers a partner for looking at what energy efficiency as a whole can play to support these policies and what new policies are needed \n  \n\u2022 Creating awareness of the breadth of products and services that exist: There are many technologies, products and services that remain on the shelf because of a lack of the right policy mix; the Alliance will create awareness of these opportunities and the policies needed  \n \n\u2022 Breaking the empty consensus on energy efficiency : Energy efficiency is supported in principle by all but often left on the sidelines when major policy is decided: the Alliance will provide a platform to break this empty consensus", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+32)02 5885672"}
