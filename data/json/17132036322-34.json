This also includes providing parliamentary representatives with materials. \n \nThe CCE prepares materials on topical economic issues and refers them to relevant departments as joint proposals of the business community. The CCE also commissions studies, thus harnessing the professional and scientific communities for the benefit of the economy. \n \nPromotion of the economy home and abroad \n \nOne of the most important tasks of the Chamber is the improvement of economic co-operation with foreign countries. This is achieved through various activities aimed at increasing the exchange of goods and services, and also at making improvements in all other forms of economic co-operation with business actors abroad. \n \nThe Chamber pays special attention to promotional activities through which the Croatian economy is represented in the respective country. Specifically, it informs business partners about the laws and regulations of the Republic of Croatia, as well as about possibilities and facilities for investment. The Chamber organizes visits for numerous foreign business representatives. It arranges meetings and concrete business co-operation with business partners abroad. It plays an important role in the promotion of export-oriented activities of the Croatian economy at well-known, leading fairs and shows abroad. \n \nAs the chief promoter and organizer of their participation at fairs and exhibitions, the Croatian Chamber of Economy supports its members both organizationally and financially in developing a successful marketing approach to the respective market. This is possible thanks to the CCE\u2019s links with chambers and economic institutions around the world, which enables Croatian companies to establish successful contacts with counterparts in the respective country or region. These activities are carried out in co-operation with county chambers, professional associations and other institutions. The Chamber assists in Croatia\u2019s efforts to follow liberalization trends in global trade in order to ensure fair competitive conditions for exports. \n \nIn 2000, the Croatian Chamber of Economy established its Representative Office in Brussels with the main aim to provide support to the Croatian business sector in the process of European integration and implementation of the rules of the European Single Market. \nThe Brussels Representative Office acts as a main link between the Croatian Chamber of Economy in Croatia and the European institutions, associations, organizations and companies in Brussels. The office supports Croatian companies in different aspects of their business  activity by: \n\u2022 Providing information on EU policies, measures and instruments; \n\u2022 Offering our members relevant information on placing their products on the European market; \n\u2022 Providing information on EU-funding and programmes, open calls and partner search; \n\u2022 Assisting with participation in EU-financed projects; \n\u2022 Answering inquiries from domestic and foreign companies on different issues such as legislation, public tendering, requirements for establishing \na company, real estate, business partners etc.; \nThe services provided by the CCE Representative Office in Brussels are the result of joint eff orts done by the entire Chamber\u2019s system in Croatia (departments, centers, professional associations and the \nCounty chambers).", "industry_forums": "", "inter_groups": "", "number_of_persons_involved": "4", "relevant_communication": "", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2017", "lat": 45.8084126, "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "0", "legal_status": "non for profit association", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Ivan Barbari\u0107", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "\u200eVice President for International Affairs and EU", "belgium_office_city": "Bruxelles", "head_office_phone": "(+385)14561555"}
