The aims of the Scheme are to: \n- Provide assurance for investors about the environmental integrity of climate bonds. \n- Provide governments with an easy-to-use tool to prioritize investments that address their climate change policy imperatives. \n- Support liquidity for climate bonds in secondary markets, as secondary markets are a pre-requisite for attracting institutional investors to the climate bonds market.", "industry_forums": "", "head_office_phone": "(+44)7525068331", "level_of_interest": "European, global", "relevant_communication": "see http://www.climatebonds.net/resources", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2016", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "1000000-1249999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "1030000", "legal_status": "Company limited by guarantee; registered charity", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Giuliani Diletta", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "Policy Officer"}
