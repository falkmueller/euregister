ED provides loan and bond level data as well as documentation repository services for the fixed income market. Developed, owned and operated by the market, and endorsed by the Eurosystem, ED helps to facilitate risk assessment and to improve transparency standards for European ABS deals. ED was created in 2012 following the establishment of the Eurosystem ABS Loan Level reporting requirements. ED became fully operational in January 2013 and is funded and owned by a mix of market participants. In addition, the European Central Bank (ECB) and the National Central Banks (NCB) participate as observers to the Board of ED. ED operates as a utility to respond to the need for improved transparency to investors and other market participants in ABS, and currently hosts data for almost 1250 Asset-Backed Securities (ABS) transactions and private portfolios belonging to several different originators across Europe. More than 400 Data Owners (DO), Data Providers (DP) and Data Users (DU) are registered with ED. Originators, issuers and servicers upload ABS data to ED, while DU including investors, data vendors, rating agencies and public institutions use ED data for monitoring and risk assessment purposes.", "industry_forums": "", "head_office_phone": "(+49)69509869300", "level_of_interest": "European", "relevant_communication": "ED key characteristics are centralisation (single centralised data repository in Europe for the ABS market), transparency and accessibility (fast access to data; disaggregated data: relevant information allows a high degree of ABS portfolio transparency) and standardisation (standardised definitions of reporting formats for quick and efficient comparison).

ED has also launched a document repository that is now available for all transactions. The documentation section is in compliance with the Bank of England reporting requirements and other EU regulations for ABS eligibility criteria. Moreover, ED has organised a series of workshops and webinars for data owners and providers in order to increase awareness of data quality issues, and has participated to the main conferences related to the ABS market organised across Europe.", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2017", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "0-9999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "0", "legal_status": "GmbH", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Marco Angheben", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "Business Development"}
