The project is lead by Hybrit Development AB (a joint venture company). \n \nThe HYBRIT Initiative aims to replace coking coal, traditionally needed for ore-based steel making, with hydrogen. The result will be unique: the world\u2019s first fossil-free steel-making technology, with virtually no carbon footprint. The goal is to have a solution for fossil-free steel by 2035. A successful HYBRIT means that together we can reduce Sweden\u2019s CO2 emissions by 10% and Finland\u2019s by 7%. \n \nHYBRIT is a unique project and the first of its kind. If the project succeeds, it will contribute to Sweden\u2019s national climate goal, to be fossil-free by 2045. In addition to this, the method offers great opportunities if applied in other Member States and also in other industries. To succeed, however, national support is required from government, research institutes and universities. A favorable regulatory framework is also an important factor for the success of the project. \n \nIn the summer of 2018 a pilot plant for fossil-free steel production strated being built in Lule\u00e5 and the Norrbotten iron ore fields, 250 km north west of Lule\u00e5. Trials are expected to start mid-2020.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+46)702680235"}
