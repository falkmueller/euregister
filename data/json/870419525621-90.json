NTUA operates as a State University with nine Schools, self-administered by the Senate, the Rector, the Vice-Rectors, the School Presidents, representatives of the academic staff and students from every School, as well as representatives from other university bodies. \n \nThe obvious need for any major institute of higher education to operate and offer education and research opportunities within a well organised and completely unambiguous internal system of principles, aims, procedures, rights and obligations, led, between the years 1997 and 2000, to the in depth internal and external evaluation of the NTUA\u2019s structure and activities and consequently to the drawing up, discussion with all NTUA\u2019s members and approval by the Senate and the Ministryof Education, (Government Gazette 1098/B/05.09.2000), of the NTUA Statute. This code of operation and development, considered as one of the best European University Statutes, defines that the main strategy of NTUA in the new millennium, is not only to maintain its position as an outstanding and internationally recognised public university of science and technology, but also to strengthen that position as regarding all its basic operations. All other strategies, aims and actions must be compatible with this basic strategic choice.", "industry_forums": "", "head_office_phone": "(+30)2107721740", "level_of_interest": "European, global, national, regional/local", "relevant_communication": "", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2016", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "0-9999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "42364580", "legal_status": "\u039d\u03a0\u0394\u0394", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "MARIA THANOU", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "HEAD OF THE FINANCIAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT UNIT"}
