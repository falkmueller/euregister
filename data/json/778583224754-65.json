The activity is governed by regulations on water and its use, feed ingredients, health/welfare and the treatment of infections, food processing and a wide range of environmental legislative instruments. \nThe AAC will be structured to address the different issues affecting it\u2019s the different components of the sector, using expertise from its member organisations and, where appropriate, scientific advice. It will accommodate new aquaculture activities, such as algae production, as these develop. \nIn line with evolving European policies and strategies, the AAC will also consider the position and contributions of aquaculture within, for example, the Bioeconomy and the Circular Economy and gather and provide such information that aquaculture stakeholders may wish to communicate. \nThe Strategic Guidelines for the Sustainable Development of European Aquaculture (COM(2013) 229 final ) identified several tasks for the Aquaculture Advisory Council, which it will endeavour to achieve. These include: \n\uf0b7 A screening of administrative procedures and a mapping exercise of the main administrative burdens in terms of time and costs, in different types of aquaculture, in the Member States; \n\uf0b7 To support structuring of the aquaculture production and marketing including certification and labelling; \n\uf0b7 To contribute to improved market intelligence of the sector; \n\uf0b7 To facilitate self-regulatory initiatives and help communicating these characteristics to the consumer; \nThe AAC may provide its advice to the European Commission, the European Parliament, the Committee of the Regions, the European Economic and Social Committee, one or several European Union Member States and any other relevant stakeholder, on any new legislative, regulatory or legal measure at European or national level, that is relevant to its objectives and the tasks defined respectively in Articles 34 and 44 of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013. \nSuch advice will be prepared following the statutory positions of the AAC and its accompanying Rules of Procedure.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+32)27200073"}
