ICOS provides standardized and open data from more than 130 measuring stations across 12 European countries. ICOS provides data that researchers transform into scientific knowledge to improve our understanding of the Earth system. Evidence-based knowledge on carbon emissions and sinks advances the fulfilment of the UN Sustainable Development Goals and EU Societal Challenges, especially the ones concerning climate change. ICOS is the major European research infrastructure contributing to the global network of international climate organizations. The knowledge generated by the use of ICOS data supports the Paris agreement and contributes to the work of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) and the Global Climate Observation System (GCOS). ICOS also actively communicates science-based knowledge towards society and seeks to provide information that is relevant to climate action and decision-making.", "industry_forums": "", "inter_groups": "", "number_of_persons_involved": "2", "relevant_communication": "ICOS is involved in a number of European Horizon 2020 projects: RINGO, ENVRIPLUS, SEACRIFOG, RISCAPE, EUDAT2020, EOSC Pilot, VERIFY, ENVRIfair, ERIC Forum.", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2017", "lat": 60.20384399999999, "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "300000-399999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "3261923", "legal_status": "International organisaiton", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Werner Kutsch", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "Director General", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+358)503523299"}
