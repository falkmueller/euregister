Access to Healthcare; Access to Medicines; Innovative Treatments; Quality of (Health)Care.  \n \nSpecific legislative and related implementation acts that the EAPC follows include: Horizon 2020 and other research initiatives, Medicines Regulation (in particular access to controlled medication), Cross-Border Healthcare Directives etc.  \n \nEAPC also follows EU initiatives in the following broad areas: Social Affairs,Skills and Education, Digital agenda, Mobility, Human Rights and Children\u2019s Rights, Justice, Disability, Employment, Consumers etc. \n \n \nThe EAPC has been involved in several European Union Funded research projects on palliative care.  As well as producing well-utilised guidelines on cancer pain management in 2001 and reviewing and revising the guidelines in 2012, the EAPC was also a partner in the European Union funded project, ATOME (Access to opioid medication in Europe). This project investigated the reasons why opioid medication was inadequately used for moderate to severe pain in twelve European countries and provided evidence to support improved access to opioids.

Since its inception, the EAPC has evolved into the leading palliative care organisation in Europe providing a forum for all of those either working, or with an interest in, palliative care throughout Europe and beyond. Currently the EAPC has 57 member associations from 32 European countries and also has individual members from 48 countries globally.  Members are engaged in palliative care from a range of perspectives; specialist clinical practice, education, policy and research.   The EAPC is respectful of the cultural and political diversities of our members across Europe but aims to ensure that as collective group that we speak with \u2018one voice-one vision\u2019 on matters important for the practice and development of palliative care.  \nPalliative care aims to improve quality of life for patients and their families who are living with a life-threatening condition. Palliative care aims to prevent or relieve suffering through early identification and impeccable assessment and treatment of pain and other symptoms (physical, psychosocial and spiritual). Most people associate palliative care with cancer and indeed, historically and from a practice perspective, the management of symptoms in advanced cancer has been the cornerstone of the work of those working in palliative care. However, since the revision of the World Health Organisation definition of palliative care in 2002 palliative care is viewed as a model of delivering care that is applicable across a range of chronic life-limiting conditions beyond cancer.  This has been further confirmed by a recent resolution from the World Health Assembly which is aimed at strengthening palliative care across the life-span which recommends equitable access to palliative care regardless of a patient\u2019s diagnosis.  The resolution provides an opportunity for the EAPC to engage with colleagues from other specialties to foster greater collaboration with the ultimate goal of an optimal quality of life experience for the patient and family in spite of their disease. Several such collaborations have been formed between the EAPC and organisations with mutual interests.", "industry_forums": "", "inter_groups": "The EAPC President was invited to present on palliative care at the European Parliament in February 2017 and has also attended the Council of Europe in Strasburg twice in the last year", "number_of_persons_involved": "1", "relevant_communication": "The EAPC is recognised by the Council of Europe, has links with the World Health Organisation and is involved in several European Union Funded research projects on palliative care.
