Since the establishment of Sino-European Panel on Land and Soil (SEPLS) in 2010, Institute of Soil Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ISSCAS) has been played an instrumental role in the development of SEPLS. ISSCAS has been chosen as one member of the Executive Committee of SEPLS, and has been responsible for the Central-eastern node of China with the representative of Ganlin Zhang. The director of out institute, Ren-Fang Shen was appointed as the Co-Chairman of SEPLS from the Chinese Academy of Sciences in China. Please see the website of SEPLS: https://esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu/InternationalCooperation/SEPLS/Index.html.     \n2. ISSCAS has participated in a series of projects funded by European Commission, such as the LAND Management: Assessment, Research, Knowledge Base (LANDMARK) (Horizon 2020, Project 635201, WP5 Partner) and Interactive Soil Quality Assessment in Europe, China for Agricultural Productivity and Environmental Resilience (iSQAPER) (Horizon 2020, Project 635750, WP2 Partner), and e-SOTER project (FP7, Project 211578, WP2 Partner) and so on. These participations enhance our understanding of the ecosystems, environment protection, pedology and agricultural management across Europe and China.

Taking iSQAPER as an example, analysis of the linkages between land use/cover and livestock systems was performed.

It has attracted and nurtured large numbers of talented soil scientists, who have been conducting continuous and fruitful research, oriented towards soil resources countrywide. The present-day institute has developed from modest beginnings into a top-notch, highly reputable, national-level research center with a solid research base covering all disciplines of soil science. In addition, it is a training base for grooming senior researchers. Its contribution to the development of soil sciences nationally as well as internationally is quite significant. The institute\u2019s research programs are always focused on solutions to vital problems in agricultural development, ecological and environmental protection, and development of soil sciences. Currently, research focuses on the following four fields: (1) soil resources and their management, (2) soil fertility and its regulation, (3) soil environment and health, and (4) soil biota and safety. The research goals are twofold\u2014(1) to provide a scientific basis for decision-making and key practical techniques for rational utilization of soil resources, for sustainable development of agriculture and for eco-environmental protection; (2) to take an active part in development of modern theories of soil science.
