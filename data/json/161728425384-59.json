Waste Management and Recycling Cluster stimulates cluster business partners through the presentation product offer under the brand of Cluster. \n \nCluster main scope is to deliver basic information and encourage SME\u2019s, public organisations and scientific institutions towards : closed-circuit Economy/Zero Waste principles of the EC Communication on the economy of the closed-circuit. Help designing segregation, or change social attitudes at local level, implement of the processes of social change in attitudes towards zero waste policy and to promote segregation at source, recycling and new technologies in waste management. \n \nWaste Management and Recycling cluster is a modern and well established organisation focusing on supporting its members but also spreading knowledge regarding waste management, recycling, CSR, EU Regulations on wastes, critical raw materials and many others, reaching SME\u2019s, public bodies and those interested in projects like RCC and Recycling Academy with lobbing activities. \n \nRecycling and Cooperation Centre (RCC) - a not profit system limited company which in 2014/2015 carried out the project: \"Recycling Cooperation System \u2013 a not profit system as a socially responsible coordinator of Waste Management and Recycling Cluster\". The aim of the project, mentioned above, was to implement CSR as a part of the project: \"Increasing region competitiveness by (CSR) corporate social responsibility activity\" funded by Swiss-Polish Cooperation Programme. The purpose of the project was to work out a consistent long-term CSR strategy and implement it taking into account three action areas: environment protection, relations with employees and social involvement. \n \nWhat is more cluster was an patron of ecological actions, that took place all over Poland and is always interested in helping and participating in this type of projects.

The main aim of the creators of the Academy of recycling is to provide domestic enterprise's knowledge of global trends and technologies in the field of management and disposal of all kinds of waste, recovery and recycling m.in ferrous and non ferrous metals, plastics, rubber, wood, glass, cellulose, and waste multi material financing investments using EU funds and the latest legal solutions and to acquire the necessary knowledge and skills in the field of municipal waste management in line with the policy of economy with a closed circuit in the field: of the communication of the European Commission, action models for municipalities in line with the policy of closed circuit, implementing change social attitudes at the local level, proper design of segregation, proper management of all municipal waste fractions, energy recovery from municipal waste, new requirements BAT for waste management, new technologies, recycling of municipal waste, spatial planning in the field of waste management, financing of investments related to municipal waste, legal aspects in particular in the field of \"green procurement\" and the public-private partnership, creating proper waste management plans. \n \nWaste Management and Recycling Cluster on April 11th organized in the Polish Parliament a national conference. \"The Polish management system of electrical and electronic equipment waste - growth or fall\", with Honorary Patronage of Deputy Speaker of Parliament, Dr. Stanislaw Tyszka. The conference was attended by people, among whom were representatives of the Parliament, the Ministry of Environment and Development, the main inspectorate of environmental protection, science, the press and representatives of the processing plants, SME\u2019s and non-governmental organizations. The main conclusion of the conference was that Polish entities involved in collection, recycling and treatment of WEEE are interested in working with science. Unfortunately, the lack of predictability of the market, changing regulations, and limited financial resources mean that companies are afraid of the risk of participating in such projects. Therefore, wanting to talk about innovation and development are urgently needed legal and financial support to the industry, and then the Polish recycling technologies will become an \"export commodity\".", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2017", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "90000", "legal_status": "none", "procurement": "", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "goals__remit": "Cluster as a collection of modern, diverse links between enterprises, scientific world, self-regulatory organisation, administration and business support institutions has been recognized in the EU and the world as one of the proven ways to implement the policy of innovation and is described as one of the most effective instruments of development policy at the level of countries and regions. \n \nA cluster is a platform and an area of cooperation of companies, often competing with one another, which through synergy and access to specific resources (knowledge, new technology, people, etc.) may in the long run achieve more for their own quantifiable, economic development than when remaining outside of the group .
