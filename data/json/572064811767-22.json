The EU  \n wood panel industry has a turnover of about  \n 22 billion euro every year, creates over 100,000  \n jobs directly and counts more than 5,000  \n enterprises in Europe.  \nFurthermore, every job in the wood-panel  \n industry generates a multiple of jobs in the  \n downstream user sectors such as the further  \n processing companies and the users in the  \n building, furniture and packaging industries,  \n which have a strong SME character.  \n  Additionally, wood panel factories are often  \n located in rural, less industrialized or developed  \n areas, making an important contribution to the  \n local economy. \n  \nSince 1 January 1999, the European Panel  \n Federation (EPF), represents the European  \n manufacturers of particleboard, MDF and  \n OSB, with a total production in 2011 of more  \n than 30 million m3 of particleboard, more  \n than 11.5 million m3 of MDF and more than  \n 3.5 million m3 of OSB. EPF thus took over  \n the tasks of FESYP, the  European federation  \n of associations of the particleboard manufacturers  \n (founded in 1958) and Euro MDF Board, the  \n European federation of MDF manufacturers  \n (founded in 1986). In March 2012 also the  \n leading European manufacturers of wet  \n process fibreboards decided to join EPF,  \n who were previously represented by FEROPA.  \n Since then, EPF also operates the \u2018Natural  \n Fibre Boards\u2019 (NFB) trademark. In March 2015,  \n EPF also welcomed the application of the majorityof the European plywood manufacturers to become regular members and constituted a dedicated plywood product group and plywood taks force.", "industry_forums": "", "head_office_phone": "(+32)25562589", "level_of_interest": "European", "relevant_communication": "", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2016", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "200000-299999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "0", "legal_status": "Association", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Kris Wijnendaele", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "Technical Director"}
