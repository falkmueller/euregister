By creating and disseminating knowledge from research findings, ECRA's aim is to facilitate and accelerate innovation to guide the cement industry.  \n  \nECRA\u2019s activities are pre-competitive and comprise seminars, workshops and dedicated research projects. Its seminars and workshops provide a platform for teaching the latest knowledge on cement and concrete technology and for communicating and discussing the latest research findings. The seminar programmes cover process and concrete-oriented issues of high concern to the cement industry. Some seminars are of specific interest to cement producers, while others provide information more important to cement associations.   \n  \nECRA understands itself as part of a network which comprises various research facilities such as universities, federal institutes and the research centres of cement companies or equipment suppliers. In this context it is able to develop a knowledge centre which benefits from cooperation with the best institutes in the respective areas of research and acts as a core competence centre providing a broad platform for top researchers in each field.", "industry_forums": "", "head_office_phone": "(+49)2112398380", "level_of_interest": "European", "relevant_communication": "COP23, 11 November 2017, Bonn: Event: \u201eLow Carbon Innovation in the Cement and Chemi-cals Industries \u2013 Status quo and Perspectives\u201c", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2017", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "10000-24999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "0", "legal_status": "GmbH", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Martin Schneider", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "Managing Director"}
