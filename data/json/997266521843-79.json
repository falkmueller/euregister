It will promote sustainable economic and social growth of the region by improving its competitiveness and connectivity -in both transport and energy fields- , while preserving the environment and ensuring healthy and balanced marine and coastal ecosystems. To this end, it will foster cross-border partnerships and synergies between local, national and regional actors across various sectors. \n \nThe Strategy will also constitute a driver of innovation in the region through the promotion of research, cluster development, knowledge and technology transfer as well as industrial partnerships, leading to increased investments which will boost the economies of the Eastern Mediterranean. By setting in motion networks and/or reinforcing existing networks between education, training and research institutions and businesses, the strategy will also contribute to jobs creation, to human capacity building and to the mobility of students, researchers and workers in the region. \n \nFurthermore, considering the geo-strategic importance of the Eastern Mediterranean, this strategy will facilitate interoperability and data exchange to improve real-time response to emergency and crisis situations and to ensure the safety and security of activities at sea, while strengthening the stakeholders\u2019 institutional and administrative capacity. \n \nIn this way, the Strategy will provide an overall framework for policy coordination, territorial cooperation and harmonized use and implementation of resources, legislations, actions and structures, contributing to the overall economic development of the Eastern Mediterranean.", "level_of_interest": "European, global, national, regional/local", "organisation_name": "Maritime Institute of Eastern Mediterranean (Mar.In.E.M.)", "belgium_office_post_code": "", "number_of_persons_involved": "7", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Ionas Koulendros", "section": "III -

The Institute acts as a Forum and a Think-Tank but also as an Incubator of Business Opportunities on Maritime and Sea Affairs, encouraging and facilitating Dialogue, Networking, Cooperation and Synergies among the sector\u2019s stakeholders in the Eastern Mediterranean Region, including the Black Sea. \n \nThe Eastern Mediterranean has been the cradle of some of the largest ancient civilizations. It is a region with considerable cultural, religious and linguistic diversity and with a rich maritime heritage which play a major role in its socioeconomic progress. Due to its geographical position -it is located at the crossroads of three continents which are connected by the sea- the Eastern Mediterranean has been facing multifaceted opportunities and challenges in the context of rapid globalization and climate change. These can be efficiently addressed only through an integrated, collaborative and responsible approach. Enhanced cooperation and coordination between various stakeholders in the region and across sectors including those of the sea -given that the sea has always been the common space between the people of the region-, will give the necessary leverage to sustainable economic development. \n \nThe \u201cMaritime Institute of Eastern Mediterranean\u201d aims through its work to benefit this Region by addressing Maritime issues of regional interest through an intra-regional and cross-sectional cooperation and coordination and on the basis of the values of mutuality, sincerity, and transparency. In particular, it undertakes and participates to Research, Technology and Innovation Initiatives and Programs which are relevant to the maritime sector and which foster knowledge and best practices exchange, technology development, transfer and application, infrastructure development as well as cluster development in the maritime sector, with a view to improving the sector\u2019s competitiveness and encouraging its sustainable growth. To this end, the Institute engages regional and international research, academic and governmental institutions, private organizations, businesses, NGOs and individuals; everyone who will endorse and share the Institute\u2019s aspirations.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+357)25025531"}
