Our information is gathered by working closely with medical doctors and HIV-positive people directly. \n \nWe believe that more knowledge strengthens the attention that is paid to an issue and that attention further strengthens the response. To help this response grow, we are working to share international knowledge that comes from all around the world with Turkey. \n  \nWe are producing projects and ideas on various social fields to make HIV be discussed in a medical/scientific context, instead of its present moral framing.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+90)2124410326"}
