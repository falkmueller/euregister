Other members send experts to countries in the Global South, while others supporte students from the Global South who come to Austria for the purpose of education. These scholarships are funded by member organisations as well as by the Austrian State.  \n \nThe Coordination Office is promoting and coordinating the commitment of the Austrian Catholic Church for development and missionary work as a universal church. It aims at awareness raising and solidarity action of people in Austria.
