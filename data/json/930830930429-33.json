We believe in the power of working together, so we work with a wide range of actors from governments, businesses, and civil society to understand the issues, advocate, and collaborate to deliver change. \nWe also advocate based on evidence. Our work is evidence-based, meaning that our conversations with policy makers \u2014 and our related advocacy campaigns \u2014 are rooted in robust research, often our own. \nFinally, we experiment and innovate.
