We deliver digital equality by securing policy change through partnerships and coalitions. We believe in the power of working together, so we work with a wide range of actors from governments, businesses, and civil society to understand the issues, advocate, and collaborate to deliver change. \nWe also advocate based on evidence. Our work is evidence-based, meaning that our conversations with policy makers \u2014 and our related advocacy campaigns \u2014 are rooted in robust research, often our own. \nFinally, we experiment and innovate. What works in one country or city won\u2019t necessarily work in another, so our local coalitions and Labs tailor solutions to local realities.", "industry_forums": "", "head_office_phone": "(+001)2025952892", "level_of_interest": "global", "relevant_communication": "N/A", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2016", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "0-9999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "3622000", "legal_status": "501(c) 3", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Craig Fagan", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "Policy Director"}
