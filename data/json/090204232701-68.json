Membership requires a functioning Demeter certification programme. Associations which support the objectives of Demeter-International can be elected as associated members. Its basis is the Biodynamic\u00ae agriculture method, originated by Rudolf Steiner in his \"Agriculture Course\" given in Koberwitz in 1924, and developed further in practice and research.", "belgium_office_city": "Brussels", "head_office_phone": "(+49)615584690"}
