A Time Allocation Committee (CAT) allocates the observing time reserved for Spain at the telescopes in the IAC's observatories. \n \nThe exceptional quality of the sky over the Canaries for astronomical observations is protected by law. The IAC's Sky Quality Protection Office (OTPC) regulates the application of the law and its Sky Quality Group continuously monitors the parameters that define observing quality at the IAC Observatories. \n \nThe IAC's research programme includes astrophysical research and technological development projects. \n \nThe IAC is also involved in researcher training, university teaching and outreach activities. \n \nThe IAC has devoted much energy to developming technology for the design and construction of a large 10.4 metre diameter telescope, the (Gran Telescopio CANARIAS, GTC), which is sited at the Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+34)922605200"}
