It also acts as a coordinating body for the enhancement of the regional economy through the promotion of the relations with other regional, national and European institutions. Some of its main activities consist in providing information on European policies, legislation and funding programmes through inquiries, seminars and training schemes; promoting partnerships between transnational public and private bodies, and coordinating multi-lateral projects.  \n \nUnioncamere del Veneto has three separate operating bodies: a General Affairs Department, a European Policy Department (known as Eurosportello) both located in Venice, and a representative office in Brussels (the Brussels Delegation).  \n \nIn order to achieve its goals, Unioncamere acts as a solid member of the European Enterprise Network and co-operates with the Veneto Regional Government, Italian and European chambers of commerce, the European Commission and various public and private associations. This dialogue at a European level is essential in influencing EU policies and gaining a voice in Europe. \n \nUnioncamere del Veneto is partner and leader in several transnational co-operation projects, providing partner search assistance and supporting the access to new markets in EU and extra-EU countries.  \n \nOur main sectors of activity are: \n\u2022 Structural Funds \n\u2022 Industrial policies \n\u2022 R&D \n\u2022 Environment \n\u2022 Competition and State aids \n\u2022 Education and professional training \n\u2022 External relations \n\u2022 Culture \n\u2022 Tourism \n\u2022 Enlargement", "belgium_office_city": "Bruxelles", "head_office_phone": "(+39)0410999411"}
