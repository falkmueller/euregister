The Institute develops research questions in dialogue with policy-makers as well as among the academic world, and delivers answers that are relevant to both sides. Its researchers focus on topics of high relevance that are aligned with societal challenges and that anticipate issues of high relevance in the near future. \n \nThis profile contrasts with profit-oriented consultancies that have neither the expertise nor the capability to provide independent research on the highest level. Similarly, research at universities cannot provide the interdisciplinary focus required for this sort of analysis. \n \n  \nStrategic Outline \n \n    The Institute brings together, and entangles, social scientific disciplines. It organizes its research along thematic, versatile research units. The Institute is a reliable partner for policy-makers as well as society at large. Its expertise is brought to fruition both academically as well as in relation to policy-making for selected research involving longer term issues. \n    IHS contributes significantly to scientific literacy in Austria by training future key personnel in society, academia, and in the public as well as the business spheres. Strong emphasis is laid on the development of appropriate innovative methods. \n    IHS maintains a high reputation for its research and is a respected Austrian hub for engaging in international scientific debates. It brings renowned guests to Austria and facilitates connections between academia, business, and politics.", "industry_forums": "", "head_office_phone": "(+43)159910", "level_of_interest": "national", "relevant_communication": "", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2017", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "100000-199999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "10329496", "legal_status": "Verein", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Martin Univ.-Prof. Dr. Kocher", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "Direktor"}
