In 2013 GSR Services started working with 4 ship recycling facilities (SRFs) in Alang / India for a gap analysis and after that towards full compliance with Hong Kong Convention which was certified by ClassNK in 2015. As of April 1st 2017 5 more SRFs have been certified (total 9 as of today), 2 have undergone final auditing and await their certificates very soon, 20 have got their audits / are certified and more than 20 facilities are in different project stages with support GSR Services. In parallel to this GSR works with six more SRFs from Pakistan for similar HKC compliance projects.  \nAim of the projects is to upgrade the ship recycling facilities from their current status to full compliance with Hong Kong Convention of IMO (HKC) and some additionally with EU-SRR. The projects are based on sharing experience, technical & legal knowledge for developing concepts jointly with the SRFs. These projects are conducted under full consideration of HKC and related 2012 Guidelines for Safe and Environmentally Sound Recycling of Ships (Res. MEPC.210(63)).  \nThese project have significantly improved the safety and environmental performance of the participating SRFs and our clients are the most renowned green and safe ship recycling providers. \n \nii.    GSR Services has prepared IHMs for two tankers and provided the owner with advice on green & safe ship recycling. This included development on criteria to be fulfilled by potential SRFs for handling of hazardous materials found on board and commercial as well as legal and contractual guidance. GSR Services was later ordered to inspect the ongoing recycling project for verification whether or not the set criteria were met by the chosen SRF. \n \niii.    GSR Services has developed the ship recycling standard for one of the biggest shipowners from Denmark and introduced him to Indian ship recyclers. With a noticeable media coverage this owner is now frequently sending his obsolete ships to selected SRFs in India. \n \nGSR has experiences in all fields related to ship recycling, from cradle to grave. Detailed insight has been gained by early involvement in the development of legal requirements at IMO including very active participation in developing all related guidelines since 2006.
