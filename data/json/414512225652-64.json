We offer market analysis, management consultancy and events. \n \nOur team of over 200 analysts, consultants and event producers have a shared mission: to deliver the highest quality business intelligence and advice to our clients in the worldwide metals, mining and fertilizer industries. \n \nEverything we do is underpinned by our independence. Put simply, we tell it like it is, without fear or favour. We don\u2019t have to check with a corporate parent to see if they approve of our conclusion. We aren\u2019t in thrall to big corporate sponsors or advertisers. \n \nWe produce research because we believe it will benefit our clients, not because we think it\u2019s newsworthy. Our events are primarily about content (though of course they\u2019re perfect networking opportunities because so many top metals, mining and fertilizer executives attend). \n \nOne of the strengths we bring to every project is to have experts on the ground in all key global locations. Our London headquarters sits at the heart of our business. Our 11 regional offices spread across the Americas, Asia and Australasia allow us to see at first hand the mines, the smelters, the mills and the processing plants our clients want us to report on. \n \nCustomer service is a big part of our business. We find that serving a global client base is best done with a global network of offices. Wherever you operate there is a CRU office local to you. Our teams are multinational and multi-lingual \u2013 we speak our clients languages.", "industry_forums": "", "inter_groups": "", "number_of_persons_involved": "1", "relevant_communication": "", "financial_year_end_date": "01/03/2017", "lat": 51.51746559999999, "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "0-9999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "", "legal_status": "Limited liability company", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Margarita  Agapidou", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "Business Development Manager, Europe", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+44)020 7903 2000"}
