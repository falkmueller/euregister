Thus, the Union of clinical biology laboratories is actively committed to coherent grouping of biologists in order to pool resources and form a bulwark against the financialization of the profession. SLBC prepares the European competition and the economic consequences of the control of expenditure of biology, and wants to foster and promote a policy of quality, which is essential for the credibility of our profession, whose accreditation is the most accomplished form.
