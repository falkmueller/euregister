A number of changes have been adopted in relation to their role, functions and composition of their membership (i.e. from 2/3 to 60:40). \n \nThe principal aim of the NWWAC is to bring together stakeholders from across Europe to advise the Commission (whether by own initiative proposals or as a result of open public consultations) on matters of fisheries management in respect of the North Western Waters - ICES areas Vb (EC waters), VI, VII. \n \nNWWAC members are composed of fishing industry, other fishing interests (processors, auctions, consumers...)and other groups of interest representatives such as environmental NGOs or anglers. Representatives of national administrations and relevant technical and scientific experts often participate in NWWAC meetings and discussions in observer capacity.", "industry_forums": "", "head_office_phone": "(+353)12144146", "level_of_interest": "European", "relevant_communication": "", "financial_year_end_date": "01/09/2017", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "300000-399999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "329194", "legal_status": "Company Limited by Guarantee - Recognised as a body pursuing an aim of general European interest", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Conor Nolan", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "Executive Secretary - NWWAC Secretariat"}
