This international e-infrastructure has delivered unprecedented data analysis capabilities to more than 38,000 researchers from many disciplines. The federation brings together more than 350 data and compute centres worldwide.  \nToday, EGI provides both technical and human services, from integrated and secure distributed high-throughput and cloud computing, storage and data resources to consultancy, support and co-development. \nThe research supported by EGI is diverse . Examples include the search for the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider particle accelerator at CERN; finding new tools to diagnose and monitor diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s, or the development of complex simulations to model climate change. For the research communities, the benefits of EGI are: \n1.    Ensuring uniform and reliable availability of resources to researchers on a local, national and European scale \n2.    Enabling faster production of scientific results through collaboration across organisational and national boundaries  \n3.    Promoting open and collaborative science and ensuring open access to shared resources and expertise \n4.    Allowing researchers to focus on their research rather than managing their e-infrastructure needs \n5.    Providing effective utilisation of resources in different administrative domains to ensure the most effective return on infrastructure investments \n6.    Facilitating the innovation and sharing of solutions by building a thriving ecosystem through community events and collaborative services.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+31)208932007"}
