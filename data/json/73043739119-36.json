We also determine the principles and values that underpin good medical practice and we take firm but fair action where those standards have not been met. \n \nWe have strong and effective legal powers designed to maintain the standards the public have a right to expect of doctors. Our mission is to protect patients. \n \nWhere any doctor fails to meet those standards, we act to protect patients from harm - if necessary, by removing the doctor from the register and removing their right to practise medicine.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+0161)9236602"}
