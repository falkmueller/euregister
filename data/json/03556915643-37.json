FSC AC is an international association of members consisting of a diverse group of representatives from environmental and social groups, the timber trade and the forestry profession, indigenous people's organizations, responsible corporations, community forestry groups and forest product certification organizations from around the world. FSC has a unique governance structure that is built upon the principles of participation, democracy and equity.  \n \nThe FSC has set Principles & Criteria as the basis for its work, and from there FSC, through decisions by its membership, agrees on forest management an chain of custody standards, delivers trademark assurance and provides accreditation services to a global network of committed businesses, organizations and communities.  \nFSC certification provides a credible link between responsible production and consumption of forest products, enabling consumers and businesses to make purchasing decisions that benefit people and the environment as well as providing ongoing business value.  \nFSC is nationally represented in more than 40 countries around the world. \nFSC is of the opinion that its trademarked products can respond to the demands for green and socially responsible products for public authorities, business and citizens, while ensuring better environmental, social and economical performance in the production side. \nIn the EU, FSC is present in most countries and it shares with its members a common aim to promote sustainable forestry in Europe and globally. Its existing certification scheme and its experience with this approach is offered as a contribution to EU forest and related policies. \n \nFSC has a varied membership, including some 475 associations with members, foundations, companies, networks as well as some 550 individuals.
