It fights for the protection and conservation of pollinators, notably bees, and promotes the transition towards alternative agricultural practices, away from the systematic use of pesticides. \n \nTo pursue its goals, POLLINIS provides both the public and European policymakers with reports and information to support laws and policies that encourage sustainable agriculture. These practices have been proven to meet our food needs and are profitable to farmers, all the while preserving product quality, human health and the environment. \n \nWe believe that agriculture has a responsibility toward the people who consume its products and who, as taxpayers, indirectly finance massive farming subsidies. To give people a voice in the debate on European \nagriculture \u2014 the environment, well-being and food safety \u2014 POLLINIS raises citizen awareness through emailing campaigns and presents petitions to policymakers and institutions. \n \nPOLLINIS focuses on the following issues: \n- The protection of pollinators, particularly wild and honey bees. \n- The progressive ban of chemical inputs (pesticides, fertilizers). \n- Farmers\u2019 self-sufficiency and satisfaction. \n- The promotion of alternative and sustainable agricultural solutions. \n \nIn addition, POLLINIS identifies and financially supports successful alternative agricultural experiments. Consequently, we offer solutions to current agricultural \npractices so that food safety and the environment \nfor future generations are assured and not threatened. \n \nPOLLINIS is proud of its ideological independence. Framing practices today are rich in credible alternative experiments from various ideological and philosophical perspectives. We do not champion any particular one, as we are interested in investigating all plans that reject current intensive agricultural patterns and offer viable solutions for farmers, while producing healthy food and protecting nature.", "belgium_office_city": "Brussels", "head_office_phone": "(+33)1 40 26 40 34"}
