We all have the same brand values, the same passion and commitment.  We have joined forces as Oxfam International because we believe we will achieve greater impact by working together in collaboration with others.  \nTogether we are working towards a world in which people can live with dignity, have their basic needs met and their basic rights respected, and have the ability to control their own lives. \nTogether we are working to achieve our vision of \u2018a just world without poverty\u2019. \n \nDevelopment \nWe work with partners and communities on long-term programs to eradicate poverty and combat injustice. Our development programs address the needs and rights or poor, vulnerable and marginalized people, based on their own initiatives and realities. \n \nEmergencies \nOxfam International is a key actor in the international humanitarian community, alleviating the suffering of millions of people around the world. We respond rapidly to emergencies when people are affected by armed conflicts or natural disasters, providing them with life-saving water and sanitation, emergency shelter and protection.  These efforts on the ground are reinforced by our advocacy work to protect people\u2019s rights in crises. In 2007, more than US$263m $ was spent assisting people affected by disasters. \n \nCampaigning & Advocacy \nOur advocacy and campaigning work is one of the most powerful and effective vehicles by which OI affiliates work together to achieve lasting change for poor women and men.  \nOxfam is part of a global movement for change. We raise public awareness of the causes of poverty and encourage ordinary people to take action for a fairer world. As advocates, we press decision makers in governments and international institutions to change policies and practices that reinforce poverty and injustice. \n \nPolicy research \nWe can speak with authority as a result of thorough research and analysis, and the real experience of our partners in developing countries.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+32)22341110"}
