The Steering Committee is the representative body of  the Civil Society Forum, which was initiated at the May 2009 Summit in Prague together with the Eastern Partnership in order to bring together civil society actors working at national and international level and to hold the EU and partner countries accountable to the commitments made within the Eastern Partnership.   \nThe Association promotes the following international non-profit goals: to provide organisational and technical support to the Steering Committee in its efforts to strengthen the diversity and plurality of public discourse and policymaking, by holding governments and public authorities accountable to the commitments made in the joint declaration of the Prague Eastern Partnership summit, signed on 7 May 2009 by the EU and the governments of the six Partner countries, and by protecting and promoting human rights, fundamental freedoms, participatory democracy, market economy, sustainable development and good governance. \nThe Civil Society Forum is the representative forum of bona fide civil society organisations from the Eastern Partnership countries (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, the Republic of Moldova and Ukraine) working with issues related to the Eastern Partnership process and of civil society organisations operating in the member states of the EU that are active in the partner countries. The Secretariat provides organisational and technical support to the Steering Committee in its efforts to strengthen the diversity and plurality of public discourse and policymaking, by holding governments and public authorities accountable to the commitments made within the framework of the Eastern Partnership and by protecting and promoting human rights, fundamental freedoms, participatory democracy, market economy, sustainable development and good governance.  \nMs Natalia Yerashevich, the Director of the Secretariat, is its legal representative and statutory officer.
