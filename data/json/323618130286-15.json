Our key interdisciplinary research areas are built around four global challenges.  These challenges are Ageing, lifestyles and health; Learning in a digitised society; Cultural encounters, mobilities and borders; and Environmental change and sufficiency of natural resources. \n  \nIn addition to a high standard of teaching, we offer our students a modern study environment, which is under constant development. Student well-being is among our primary concerns. \n  \nWe have extensive international relations and are involved in several international networks. Our teaching and research staff and students are active in participating in various mobility programmes. We have concluded bilateral agreements of cooperation with approximately 100 universities abroad. Furthermore, we are involved in several international networks and discipline-specific projects. \n  \nTogether with our networks, we support the well-being and positive development of eastern Finland.
