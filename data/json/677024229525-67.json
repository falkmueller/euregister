One of JPI Oceans\u2019 goals is to develop joint research programmes in which countries can be involved on a voluntary basis (variable geometry). Participating countries also decide what contribution to make: this may include institutional, project-related or new funding. \n \nJPI Oceans aims to add value by: \n1.    avoiding fragmentation and unnecessary duplication, \n2.    planning common and flexible initiatives, \n3.    facilitating cooperation and foresight, and \n4.    establishing efficient mechanisms for interaction and knowledge transfer between the scientific community, industry & services, and policy makers at high level in order to solve the grand challenges more effectively. \n \nhttp://www.jpi-oceans.eu/", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+0032)026261660"}
