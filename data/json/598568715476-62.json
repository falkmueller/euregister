These projects have built the orgnisation\u2019s skills and expertise in delivering large scale, multi-year projects with clear benefits for the natural world. \n \nAdditionally, BirdLife Malta has developed a thorough understanding of the breeding and migrating birds of Malta through many years of research, supported by a team of voluntary bird ringers.  The research led to the publication of the Malta Breeding Bird Atlas (2008) and the definitive Breeding Birds of Malta (2011).  This research has helped to determine where there are opportunities to re-establish breeding bird species in Malta to increase biodiversity. \n \nBirdLife Malta is a registered voluntary organisation (VO/0052) operating under an agreed statute and governed by a Council of Trustees elected by the membership every two years.  The organisation is managed by an Executive Director and work is delivered by a team of staff with expertise in conservation, research, education and environmental communications.  This is underpinned by a financial and administrative team and large numbers of volunteers who actively work to support the organisation.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+356)21347644"}
