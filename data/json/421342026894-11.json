Thanks to its high networking capabilities at the European level, the Centre offers the possibility to gather the necessary human and financial resources to realize projects that integrate scientific excellence with management ability and concrete results. The Centre also acts as a flexible and reliable interface between academia and industry to promote the effective transfer of knowledge and technology. \nIn line with the EU2020 Strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, ARCHES aims above all at the creation of knowledge by establishing collaborations with universities and research centres and by promoting the training of young scientists. It also promotes the recognition of female talent in science and the career of women in scientific research. In this direction, ARCHES adheres to the European Platform of Women Scientists (EPWS) as supporting organisation. \nIn 2009, ARCHES co-founded the Brussels-based Knowledge4Innovation (K4I) platform to encourage the innovation dialogue among the main political, industrial and academic actors on the European scene. In 2015 it signed a co-operation agreement with Fraunhofer IMW, the Fraunhofer Centre for International Management and Knowledge Economy (Leipzig) to successfully make use of global opportunities in the field of science, technology and innovation, with a specific focus on India.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+39)0804968546"}
