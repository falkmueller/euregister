We mostly participate indirectly in these consultations through intermediary organizations (such as international university networks, Flemish inter-university bodies or Flemish R&I stakeholder platforms), although direct participations at individual level may also occur occasionally. The same holds for preparing, circulating and communicating position papers. We contributed for instance to the Flemish position paper on the Interim Evaluation of Horizon 2020 (see EC website: https://ec.europa.eu/research/evaluations).  \nUAntwerp professors participate regularly in EC expert groups and other platforms (e.g. in scientific advisory boards of Joint Programming Initiatives or EU-funded projects).

UAntwerp was founded in 2003 after the merger of three smaller universities (RUCA, UFSIA and UIA). The university's roots go back to 1852. \nIn 2016 the University ranked 10th in the \u201cTop 50 Universities Under 50 years\u201d. It has over 1800 PhD students, around 620 tenured professors, around 290 assistants and around 3000 researcher and education staff members, thereby employing 88 different nationalities.
