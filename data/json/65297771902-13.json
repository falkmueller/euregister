Through our network we work together to promote and support volunteering through advocacy, knowledge sharing and capacity building & training. In this way we reach out to the many thousands of volunteers and volunteer organisations who look to volunteer centres a source of support bringing the European dimension to their work. \n \nCEV channels the collective priorities and concerns of its member organisations to the institutions of the European Union and the Council of Europe. Together with other European networks active in volunteering we exchange policy, practice and information in order to ensure effective and coherent follow up to European Year of Volunteering 2011 and ensure its legacy through the implementation of the Policy Agenda for Volunteering in Europe (P.A.V.E). \n \nCEV\u2019s vision is a Europe in which volunteering is central in building a cohesive and inclusive society based on solidarity and active citizenship. Our mission is to contribute to the creation of an enabling political, social and economic environment in Europe where the full potential of volunteering can be realised. \n \nTogether with our members we work to: \n \n\u2022 Be the representative voice for volunteering infrastructure in Europe \n \n\u2022 Strengthen the infrastructure for volunteering across Europe \n \n\u2022 Promote volunteering as an expression of European values. \n \nOur strategic objectives: \n \n\u2022 Knowledge Sharing: To serve as a knowledge and research resource for volunteering funding and practice in Europe. \n \n\u2022 Partnerships/Networking: Developing partnerships and alliances with key stakeholders across all sectors to promote and win recognition for volunteering as an expression of active citizenship in Europe. \n \n\u2022 Policy/Advocacy: Acting as a bridge for communication between volunteer infrastructure organisations and the work of the European institutions contributing to the development of policies to promote and support the role of volunteering as an expression of active citizenship in Europe. \n \n\u2022 Training and Capacity Building: To promote innovation and good practice in the field of supporting and reinforcing volunteering, participation and active citizenship through exchange, structured dialogue and network-building. \n \n \nCEV\u2019s initiative and facilitating role was a crucial element in the civil society campaign achieving the European Year of Volunteering 2011 together with all our partner networks active in volunteering at the European level. These networks formed the \u2018EYV 2011 Alliance\u2019 and CEV was been mandated to host the Secretariat for the implementation of the civil society strand of the European Year of Volunteering 2011.", "industry_forums": "", "inter_groups": "", "number_of_persons_involved": "6", "relevant_communication": "", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2017", "lat": 50.83792219999999, "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "100000-199999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "241300", "legal_status": "AISBL", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Gabriella Civico", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "Director", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+32)427064353"}
