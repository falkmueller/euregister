During a meeting of Ministers in charge of Vocational Education and Training, European Social Partners and the European Commission in Riga in June 2015, Michael Moriarty, as President of EFEE, signed a joint pledge with ETUCE representatives on apprenticeships. \nWith the pledge, EFEE and ETUCE wish to: \n* improve the esteem, image and quality of VET and apprenticeships \n* improve social dialogue on this issue at European and national level, and \n* improve cooperation between schools and companies on organisation and quality assurance of apprenticeships and work-\u00adbased learning. \nThe pledge underlines EFEE\u2019s and ETUCE\u2019s commitment to enhance the work of their organisations and the joint activities in the framework of the European Sectoral Social Dialogue in Education to further contribute to the implementation of the goals of the European Alliance for Apprenticeships. \nAt the same meeting, organised by the Latvian Presidency, Ministers from the EU, Candidate Countries and the EEA Countries endorsed the \u201cRiga Conclusions\u201d on a new set of priorities to improve Vocational Education and Training for the period of 2015-2020.  \nETBI, through its membership of EFEE, is involved in a significant European research project jointly led by European Centre of Employers and Enterprises providing Public services (CEEP) and EFEE. \n \nThe aim of the project is to generate European policy recommendations regarding how the competences provided by education and training institutions might better meet the competence requirement of public service employers in Europe. \nFocusing on public service sectors such as education and training, health care, public transport, energy and public administration, national VET associations and intermediary bodies, and other stakeholders from the world of education and work, the project is mapping the current and future competence needs, documenting the competences that education and training providers claim to provide to prospective public servants and identifying the competence gap and the good practice that public service employers and others implement to bridge that gap.  \nETBI is also a founder member of EUproVET, a representational platform for European VET providers which addresses education policy issues at EU level.", "level_of_interest": "national", "organisation_name": "Education and Training Boards Ireland (ETBI)", "belgium_office_post_code": "", "procurement": "", "section": "III - Non-governmental organisations", "lon": -6.669819700000001, "source": "", "belgium_office_address": "", "belgium_office_phone": "", "number_of_ep_accredited_persons": "", "overall_budget_turnover_as_a_range": "", "subsection": "Non-governmental organisations, platforms and networks and similar", "no_geo_reference": true, "persons_accredited_for_access_to_european_parliament_premises": "", "estimate_of_costs_absolute_amount": "", "registration_date": "22/03/2017", "website_address": "http://www.etbi.ie", "commission_expert_groups_and_other_similar_entities_european_commission": "NA", "head_office_post_box": "", "head_office_city": "Naas, Co Kildare", "membership": "* EFEE (European Federation of Education Employers) \nhttp://www.educationemployers.eu/ \n* EUproVET (European Providers of Vocational Education and Training) \nhttp://www.euprovet.eu/", "head_office_post_code": "W91 K729", "goals__remit": "In the (Ireland) Education and Training Boards Act 2013, Education and Training Boards Ireland (ETBI) is \ndefined as an association established to collectively represent Irish Education and Training Boards (ETBs) and promote their interests. \nVision: \nTo be an effective organisation that represents and promotes the development of the ETB sector by \nproviding innovative and high-quality support services to meet the needs of ETBs and other stakeholders in the rapidly-changing world of Irish public-sector education and training.
