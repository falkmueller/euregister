ELPA devotes a great deal of time, energy and funding to innovation and development, in particular as regards innovative technological solutions for the purposes of companies faced with extreme operating conditions or machines and devices, such as high temperatures, high pressures, excessive wear and tear, high frequency noise, etc. In developing machines and devices the company deploys state-of-the-art technologies and seek environmentally friendly solutions. \nEconomic benefits represent another important factor as ELPA's systems significantly reduces not only wear and tear of frictionally contacted surfaces and noise but also vibrations and jolts and with that extends the useful life of frictionally contacted surfaces. \n \nTechnology \n \nWONROSTM Technology \u2013 registered trade mark \n \nWONROSTM Technology (Wear Out and Noise Reduction On Source), developed and owned by ELPA, eliminates noise on source, caused by friction between two metal surfaces and thus preserves wheels, rails, brakes \u2026 from wearing out. Entire technology is built around patented multi rail preserving systems, special heavy duty appliances, designed with rail maintenance, vandalism and energy independence in mind, by using special environmentally friendly CHFC (composite heavily-fluid compounds) materials, applied on sources of noise and for that reducing maintenance costs on rail infrastructure as on railways, tramways, hump yards, shunting stations, classification yards, marshalling yards under Rail Inoperability and Directive on Environmental Noise, as being also awarded by UIC, European Commission for the Environment and certified by T\u00dcV S\u00dcD Rail and SIQ. \n \nWONROSTM Technology is being effective against: \n \n-    rail/wheel/brake generated noise \n-    wear out of interactively burdened metal contact surfaces  \n-    GCC (gauge corner cracking) \n-    RCF (rolling contact fatigue) \n-    sinus-line (corrugation) \n-    etc., where LCC costs at influence area are significantly reduced. \n \nOur business culture \nCreating \u201csustainable value\u201d is our purpose that unites all of us at Elpa. We want to create value \u2013 for our customers, for our teams and our people, as well as for the wider society and communities in which our products operate.
