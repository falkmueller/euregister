The network is a platform for the exchange of knowledge and expertise between academics, policy-makers, practitioners and NGOs in the field of immigration and asylum law and policy. The network has an administration team based in Brussels, and brings together experts from all EU Members States (with the exception of Estonia), Norway, Switzerland and Iceland. Since 1999, the Odysseus Network has grown to include around 50 members. The network has created a pan-European community of researchers and experts in the field of EU immigration and asylum, and through this strengthened cooperation, it provides a comprehensive analysis of migration issues, both at the European and national levels.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+32)476282249"}
