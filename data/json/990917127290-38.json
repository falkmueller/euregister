Structured as a spin-out from the university, the company raised Euro 3.5m of venture capital and grant funding from the UK Government and launched the business in September 2015.  The goal of the funding is to commercialise the technology developed by Professor Ashwin Seshia with an initial market application in the oil and gas industry.  The technology is a micro-electro-mechanical system which can measure tiny changes in Earth\u2019s gravity which can be used to detect the location of oil or water deep underground.  Based on the same system a gyroscope has been developed allowing the gravity sensor to be placed very precisely in an oil reservoir.  The level of accurate positioning has very wide application outside of the oil and gas industry and one area of significant interest is in the navigation system for driver-less cars in which the location technology does not rely on GPS signals.", "industry_forums": "", "inter_groups": "", "number_of_persons_involved": "4", "relevant_communication": "", "financial_year_end_date": "01/09/2017", "lat": 52.2348893, "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "50000-99999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "0", "legal_status": "Limited liability company registered in England", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Paul Vickery", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "Director", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+44)01223 421911"}
