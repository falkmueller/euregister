European Charter for the Safeguarding of Human Rights in the City:   \n UCLG-MEWA works for awareness-raising and overall implementation of the provisions of the Charter in the MEWA region. In line with this aim, UCLG-MEWA offers the Turkish and Arabic translations of the document for the use of all relevant stakeholders in the region, and promotes its implementation. \n2.    European Charter for Equality of Women and Men in Local Life:  \nUCLG-MEWA Committee on Gender Equality is working for strengthening the role of local authorities as the closest governing body to the individuals, in the fight against gender inequality. Doing so, the Committee regards this Charter as the main reference document of its works. Bringing the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda together with the principles of the Charter, the Committee members adopted \u201cCommitment for the Localization of the Sustainable Development Goal 5 on Gender Quality and Women\u2019s Empowerment\u201d. Within the context of the achievement of the Goal 5, the Commitment urges all UCLG-MEWA members to sign an implement this Charter, to establish equality units within and to send reports to the monitoring group to be formed. \n3.    European Charter of Local Self-Government: As an association of local governments, UCLG-MEWA adopts local self-government as its core principle. UCLG-MEWA Committee on Local Governance, in particular, works for strengthening transparency, local financing, participative democracy and multilevel governance throughout the MEWA region. In line with this aim, the Committee works closely with citizens\u2019 assemblies, canalizing their power of accessing the most genuine form of public support for achieving global goals. UCLG-MEWA also translated the Charter to its other working languages (Turkish, Arabic).  \n4.    European Commission Communication on Empowering Local Authorities in Partner Countries for Enhanced Governance and More Effective Development Outcomes: As per the relevant decisions by the EU and its FPA with UCLG,  of which UCLG-MEWA is an affiliate, the EU supports us for our strategic work program in the period 2015-2020. UCLG-MEWA used the allocation in 2017 mainly for reasons such as:  \nUCLG-MEWA Booklet (in Arabic Turkish and English), Research Book on the Local Governments in the MEWA Region, 4 Issues of UCLG-MEWA Newsletter (http://uclg-mewa.org/agendas/), Executive Summary of GOLD IV Report (in Arabic Turkish and English) (https://www.uclg.org/en/Gold4) \n5.    The New European Consensus on Development \u2018Our World, Our Dignity, Our Future\u2019: In line with the goal of EU member states to respond to the current global challenges in the light of the 2030 Agenda, UCLG-MEWA has determined the successful implementation and localization of the SDGs as a basis for all its actions. Taking benefit of its deep experience as the regional coordinator of the MDGs under Local Agenda 21 Program, UCLG-MEWA focuses on awareness-raising campaigns, publications (translation of UCLG publications in Arabic and Turkish), trainings and reference documents based on the Goals, for the dissemination of the Goals.  \n6.    Policy Forum on Development: Since 2012, UCLG-MEWA has been an active member of the Policy Forum on Development (PFD). Inspired by the shared spirit of the PFD, UCLG-MEWA has developed a multi-stakeholder approach in policy making and advocacy. These efforts resulted in several partnerships with academics, Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) and private sector which created a favorable dynamic among LAs. As the Neighborhood South countries have been facing dramatic levels of human and infrastructure destruction, one could not thing about possible reconstruction without the support of local governments and communities. Bringing the perspective of national and local governments in the MEWA region, to the table, UCLG-MEWA actively participates in and contributes to the efforts of PFD.", "financial_year_end_date": "01/09/2017", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "700000-799999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "713008", "legal_status": "Association", "procurement": "", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "goals__remit": "In parallel with the UCLG World Organization, UCLG-MEWA aims to be the united voice and world advocate of democratic local self-government, promoting its values, objectives and interests, through cooperation between local governments, and within the wider international community, throughout the MEWA region.  \n \nThe mission of UCLG-MEWA is, to promote strong and effective democratic local self-government throughout the region; to promote unity and cooperation amongst its members; to ensure the effective political representation of local government to the international community, in particular the United Nations and its agencies; to be the regional and worldwide source of key information and intelligence regarding local government; to be the regional and worldwide source of learning, exchange and capacity-building, supporting the establishment and strengthening of free and autonomous local governments and their national associations.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+90212)5111010"}
