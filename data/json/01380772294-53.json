This implies an active work on communication to ensure that information are delivered in both directions: from managers towards the EU decision makers and from them back to the managers. EF has a well established and efficient communication system and network to reach members and interested partners all over Europe: a multi language website, twitter and Facebook accounts, together with linkedin and flicker for the dissemination of information and news. EF publishes a bimonthly news and an annual publication Protected Areas In-Sight. Further an annual report is also published every year.  \nEF organizes annually an international conference for 300 PA managers and experts fro all over Europe.
