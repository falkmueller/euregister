IETA has established a number of Working Groups that meet regularly and organise events on topics like emissions trading, technical aspects of carbon markets, registry accounts and monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV). \nIETA continues to map down initiatives that work in developing components of the carbon markets and help create an effective and well functioning carbon market.  \n- Promote market mechanisms and participation in carbon markets. IETA continues to promote market mechanisms and trading as the solution to the business community to minimize costs effectively.   \n- Development of a global carbon market. A critical element in IETA's work remains the linking of trading regimes among Annex I countires, and its significance for the GHG market.  \n- Capacity Building, by developing and delivering courses on carbon markets, the effective functioning of an emissions trading system and the monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) component.", "belgium_office_city": "Brussels", "head_office_phone": "(+41)22 737 05 00"}
