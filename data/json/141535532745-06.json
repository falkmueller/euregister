Plastics are increasingly used in building and construction applications to make our buildings more sustainable, from window frames and durable pipes to state-of-the-art insulation solutions. An essential pillar of our cause is the ambition for greater fire safety across the construction industry. It is a key driver of our product design and manufacturing: improving the fire safety of buildings is a joint responsibility of the whole value chain involved in building and construction. That\u2019s why, by engaging with policy makers and stakeholders, we are committed to supporting the EU in ensuring safe and sustainable construction for people across Europe.", "industry_forums": "", "head_office_phone": "(+32)26761755", "level_of_interest": "European", "relevant_communication": "", "financial_year_end_date": "", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "0", "legal_status": "none", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Quentin de Hults", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "Executive Chair"}
