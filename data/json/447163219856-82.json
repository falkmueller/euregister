From enrolment to graduation, students are trained to assess the importance of academic problems and the relevance of selected theories and methods on a scientific basis. Project work is participant-directed and builds on the importance of student commitment and own and joint responsibility. \n \nThe phased choice of specialisation is based on the students\u2019 experience with the problem areas of the individual subjects and the scientific approaches. Students gain their first experience at the basic studies, which point them in the direction of advanced-level courses, where many different specialised course studies may be combined within and across disciplines and main subject areas, both during the bachelor studies and the master\u2019s studies. \n \nAt RUC, students are responsible for and control their education themselves. Based on their own critical sense and active participation, students are guided through their study programmes at RUC which offers an international, interdisciplinary and educationally challenging environment providing the perfect framework for their studies.", "industry_forums": "", "head_office_phone": "(+45)46742000", "level_of_interest": "European, national, regional/local", "relevant_communication": "", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2017", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "103742617", "legal_status": "Public body", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Henning Klarlund", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "Senior Research Policy & Funding Adviser"}
