EPLO wants the EU to recognise the crucial connection between peacebuilding, the eradication of poverty, and sustainable development worldwide and the crucial role NGOs have to play in sustainable EU efforts for peacebuilding, conflict prevention and crisis management.  \n \nEPLO advances the interests of its members through common policy positions and consequently advocating for those common positions. EPLO disseminates information and promotes understanding of EU policies of concern to its members. The Office also builds solidarity and co-operation amongst EPLO members and with other relevant NGO networks. Finally, EPLO raises awareness about the contribution which the EU should make to peacebuilding and the need to hold the EU accountable to its own political commitments of helping secure peace within and outside its borders.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+32)22333737"}
