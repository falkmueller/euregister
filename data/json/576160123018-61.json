Support for Government Policy Making: to engage with the Crown Commercial \nService and provide expert opinion on the implementation of electronic \ninvoicing by the UK Public Sector as described in the Small Business Enterprise \nand Employment Act. The forum intends to argue the case for an \u2018e-invoicing/e-procurement \nchampion\u2019, who will be responsible for advising on existing EU \ndirectives and for delivering widespread e-invoicing adoption across the UK \npublic sector. Another key area is the creation of an \u2018e-invoicing national \nframework agreement\u2019 that is re-usable across all public sector entities. The \nforum believes that the creation of a framework will increase the adoption of e-invoicing. \n \n2.
