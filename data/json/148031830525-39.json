FOGGS is a Public Benefit Foundation under Belgian law and is governed by its statutes. \n \nThe FOGGS founders were inspired by the work of the UN Secretary-General\u2019s High-Level Panel on Global Sustainability (2010-2012), which, among other things, was instrumental in introducing the concept of Sustainable Development Goals. The initial aspiration was for FOGGS to continue the Panel\u2019s work, including in the area of the economy, which had proven particularly sensitive for the Panel to tackle. \n \nSince December 2017, FOGGS has been relaunched with new ambition and primary focus on putting together a positive and sustainable \u201cGrand Narrative\u201d for the era of globalisation that we are living in. \n \nThe Grand Narrative is a story that brings together humankind and reconciles it with the planet we live on. It is a means to re-tool personal, business and political choices and apply in practice an innovative and sustainable economy geared towards well-being, a society that respects diversity, a natural environment that is at balance and systems of governance that are transparent, inclusive and work for all.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+32)483692536"}
