The vanishing electrical resistance of superconductors is the most prominent which allows e.g. current densities about 100.000 times higher than copper and the generation of extremely high magnetic fields at only small losses. Such intrinsic performance advantages of superconductors make them an obvious choice for overcoming technological barriers. \n \nThe central objective of Conectus is to strengthen the basis for commercial applications of superconductivity in Europe: \n \nConectus is a consortium of companies with the shared vision that commercialization of superconductivity will translate into significant benefits to Europe\u2019s economy and society. \n \nConectus provides a platform for industry to exchange information and to provide a united voice on public policy issues of common interest to superconductivity stakeholders.", "industry_forums": "", "head_office_phone": "(+44)1865724139", "level_of_interest": "European", "relevant_communication": "", "financial_year_end_date": "01/08/2017", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "10000-24999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "0", "legal_status": "company limited by guarantee and not having a share capital", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Joachim Bock", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "Company Secretary"}
