The Bar Standards Board was established by the Bar Council to deal with the regulation of barristers.  \n \nSince much of the law of England and Wales originates from the institutions of the European Union, in 1999 the Bar Council opened a representative office in Brussels, to act as the Bar\u2019s eyes, ears and mouth at the heart of EU decision-making.  It keeps the Bar informed of EU developments on a wide range of issues that directly affect its practitioner members and their clients.  It also acts as the central conduit for communicating the knowledge and expertise of the English Bar to European policy makers, much of it generated by Specialist Bar Associations working within the Bar Council\u2019s structure, and coordinated by the Bar Council\u2019s EU Law Committee.", "industry_forums": "", "head_office_phone": "(+44)02072420082", "level_of_interest": "European, national, regional/local", "relevant_communication": "", "financial_year_end_date": "01/03/2017", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "100000-199999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "0", "legal_status": "Unincorporated association", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Evanna Fruithof", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "Consultant Director, Bar Council Brussels Office"}
