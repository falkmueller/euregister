The biennial survey on supply and sanitation services is a valuable benchmarking tool at sector and country level. The technical meetings are the best possible forum for knowledge and information exchange. \n \nAEAS has established Technical Commissions and Working Groups that provide support, develop studies, reports and proposals on the different areas of urban water cycle: abstraction and water treatment engineering; quality and water treatment; distribution networks; urban drainage and sewerage; waste water treatment; management and commercial relations; economics and statistics; RDI; CSR. \n \nAEAS works in close cooperation with EurEau and other international associations such as IWA, OECD (being member of the Steering Committee of the OECD Water Governance Initiative) and Latin- American associations.", "industry_forums": "", "head_office_phone": "(+34)914490910", "level_of_interest": "European, global, national", "relevant_communication": "Attendance and participation at events of MEP Water Group and the Intergroup on Climate change, sustainable development and biodiversity", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2016", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "0", "legal_status": "association", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Gari Villa-Landa Sokolova", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "Head of International Affairs"}
