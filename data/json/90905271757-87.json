ETRC also seeks to ensure that future legislation does not hinder or damage the industry but promotes growth and innovation ultimately for the benefit for all travellers within the EU. \n \nETRC has a keen interest in the review of the Air Passenger Rights Regulation which has been held up in Council due to an unrelated political dispute and, although welcoming the Commission\u2019s publication of Indicative Guidelines on current air passenger rights, looks forward to the eventual adoption of the revised regulation which recognizes that airlines should not be allowed to impose a \u201cone-bag rule\u201d on passenger\u2019s hand luggage. \n  \nAnother issue that has been the subject of intense activity with the European Institutions over the years has been associated with the problems encountered by the carriage of duty free liquids, etc. (LAGs) as a consequence of the upgraded aviation security rules adopted following the terrorist threat to trans-Atlantic aircraft in August 2006. ETRC continues to participate in the process of developing upgraded security systems that will simplify and facilitate passengers\u2019 movement through airport security and ease the restrictions on the carriage of LAGs by travellers. ETRC also contributes to the discussions on enhancing maritime security. \n \nETRC has also been representing its members interests with regards to the growing demand for the provision of information to consumers that impacts several product categories sold in duty-free and travel retail; food, alcohol, and cosmetics. ETRC is pro-actively advocating for the recognition of the use of digital labelling. \n \nETRC, its member associations and companies are following closely the implementation of the Tobacco Products Directive, specifically related to implications for the duty free channel as the Member States adopt the new rules in national legislation, particularly on Track & Trace requirements.", "organisation_name": "European Travel Retail Confederation (ETRC)", "belgium_office_post_code": "1040", "number_of_persons_involved": "2", "procurement": "", "section": "II - In-house lobbyists and trade/business/professional associations", "source": "", "belgium_office_address": "RUE DE LA SCIENCE 41", "subsection": "Trade and business associations", "belgium_office_phone": "(+32)27920243", "number_of_ep_accredited_persons": "1", "overall_budget_turnover_as_a_range": "", "belgium_office_city": "BRUSSELS", "persons_accredited_for_access_to_european_parliament_premises": "SPINKS#Keith", "estimate_of_costs_absolute_amount": "350000", "registration_date": "26/05/2009", "website_address": "http://www.etrc.org", "commission_expert_groups_and_other_similar_entities_european_commission": "European Alcohol and Health Forum#E02224#http://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regexpert/index.cfm?do=groupDetail.groupDetail&groupID=2224#Member#C#Stakeholders Advisory Group on Maritime Security #E01087#http://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regexpert/index.cfm?do=groupDetail.groupDetail&groupID=1087#Member#C#Excise Contact Group #E02806#http://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regexpert/index.cfm?do=groupDetail.groupDetail&groupID=2806#Member#C#Stakeholders' Advisory Group on Aviation Security#X02883#http://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regexpert/index.cfm?do=groupDetail.groupDetail&groupID=2883#Member#C", "head_office_post_box": "", "head_office_city": "Dorking", "membership": "ETRC is a founding member of the Duty Free World Council (DFWC).  \nLink: www.dfworldcouncil.com", "head_office_post_code": "RH4 2TU", "goals__remit": "The European Travel Retail Confederation (ETRC) is an industry association for the duty free and travel retail industry in Europe, serving the industry and its members to help create the right environment to allow the industry to achieve its potential and protect it when challenges arise. \n \n\u2022    ETRC serves to facilitate contact between members by organising seminars, conferences and meetings \n \n\u2022    ETRC provides tailored support programmes to members to promote the highest operating standards and responsible retailing in international travel \n \n\u2022    ETRC undertakes detailed research into relevant industry issues and provides actionable data relevant to members \n \n\u2022    ETRC communicates regularly with its members to spread awareness about the industry and the importance of duty free and travel retail for airports, airlines, ferries, cruise lines, retailers and brand owners \n \n\u2022    ETRC works closely with member companies, and other industry trade associations to identify challenges, where advocacy is required with European and national governments and regulatory bodies in order to safeguard and grow the business \n \n \nETRC is composed of national trade associations and direct corporate membership representing over 500 European companies.
