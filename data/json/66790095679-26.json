We also work with communities recovering from war or experiencing \nprolonged crisis or conflict. The IRC was founded in 1933 at the request of Albert Einstein.  \n \nWhen an emergency arises, the IRC arrives on the scene within 72 hours with urgently needed supplies and expertise that protect people caught in the midst of chaos. We commit to stay as long as we are needed, helping survivors to heal, recover and rebuild their communities to be stronger, more stable and more democratic.  \n \nFrom the first moment the IRC hits the ground we work toward lasting solutions. Building local capacity and self-sufficiency -and promoting human rights, participation and accountability - are at the core of all of our innovative programs. \n  \nThe IRC also seeks to bring attention to forgotten or neglected crises and to pressure governments and international organizations to take action to help and protect refugees, displaced people and other victims of conflict.  \n \nIn light of the European Refugee Crisis, the IRC has increased its activities in Europe, both in supporting the refugees upon their arrival, and in advocating on their behalf for a humane solution for those fleeing violence. \n \nIRC advocacy is fueled by an understanding of situations on the ground and in the field that comes from working on a daily basis with people affected by war and violence.  It is rooted in a tradition of speaking out on behalf of the oppressed and forgotten that dates back to 1933.", "industry_forums": "", "head_office_phone": "(+212)5513000", "level_of_interest": "global", "relevant_communication": "", "financial_year_end_date": "01/09/2017", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "100000-199999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "641686560", "legal_status": "NGO", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Melanie Ward", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "Associate Director of Policy and Advocacy"}
