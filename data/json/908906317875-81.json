Planting trees can halt global warming by restoring the hydrological process of our planet. \nWeForest is contributing in 3 ways:  \n1.    Demonstrating it is possible with scalable best practices on the ground (with over 12 million trees to date and capacity and plans for 50 million in the next 4 years). \n2.    Promoting the scientific exchange and dissemination on the dynamics of global hydrology and trees for climate. WeForest is advancing the forest/water-cycle/climate research by organising for example  a high level scientific conference in June 2015 for 40 international researchers with the University of Leuven, Belgium. \n3.    Creating a movement with corporate brands (over 120 to date) who use trees as a currency to engage consumers, drawing on marketing and CSR budgets to Make Earth Cooler.", "industry_forums": "", "head_office_phone": "(+32)474070762", "level_of_interest": "global", "relevant_communication": "Policy brief ( published Sept 2015) with KUL and 40 global scientists on \"Why do forest matter for water and climate change?
