CEO believes that the Transparency Register fails basic transparency standards and does not yet live up to its name. We support ALTER-EU's demand for a legally-binding register, stronger safeguards against inaccurate reporting, and the publication of the names of all individual interest representatives. \n \nWhen registering, we have chosen to provide additional information that we consider necessary and relevant for lobbying transparency. A credible EU lobbying transparency register should include names of individual lobbyists and the issues that they try to influence, provide precise and comparable financial information on lobbying, and have effective monitoring and sanctions to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information disclosed. In an effort to arrive at a more objective way of calculating lobbying expenditures, we follow guidelines that result from consultations with public interest organisations, professionals working on lobby transparency as well as experts of US lobby disclosure legislation. Our registration is therefore providing a more comprehensive calculation of our expenses for activities that aim to influence the policy formulation and decision-making processes of the European institutions, and a list of those who, on behalf of Corporate Europe Observatory, carry out such activities. Our registration is based on the guidelines for transparent registration developed by the Civil Society Contact Group and ALTER-EU. Find the guidelines here: http://www.alter-eu.org/documents/2012/04/transparency-register-guidelines \n \nIn 2017-18 Corporate Europe Observatory runs campaigns and conducts research on the following issues (among others): \n \n- corporate political influence at EU level \n- EU lobby transparency and ethics rules \n- conflicts of interest rules of EU institutions \n- agri-business, chemicals, plastics, and biodiversity \n- climate and energy, including Dieselgate \n- international trade and investment rules \n- regulation of financial markets \n- EU economic governance \n- better regulation \n- digital single market", "industry_forums": "", "head_office_phone": "(+32)28930930", "level_of_interest": "European", "relevant_communication": "This information is available on our website: http://corporateeurope.org/", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2017", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "905777", "legal_status": "Foundation under Dutch law (Stichting)", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Olivier Hoedeman", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "Research and campaigns coordinator"}
