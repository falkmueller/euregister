We aim to stimulate public debate about humanity\u2019s future and equip our audiences at every level \nwith an understanding of science. That purpose has never been more important or more urgent. Species and ecosystems are being destroyed faster than we can describe them or understand their significance. \nThe very resources on which modern society relies are under threat.  \n \nWe will use the unique combination of our collection, expertise and public reach to engage people with three big narratives that together underpin an understanding of the natural world and our place in it: \n \nOrigins and evolution \nThe 4.5 billion year history of our solar system, the Earth and life \n \nDiversity of life \nToday\u2019s natural diversity across species, habitats and ecosystems \n \nSustainable futures \nThe future of the natural systems on which our society depends \n \nThe Museums collections, data portal, laboratories, research staff and libraries, enable it to function both as a research provider, a large research infrastructure and a big data provider, active in collaboration with EU and global partners and hosting thousands of international researchers each year.  Its science education, citizen science and online resources provide innovative engagement to the public in the EU and elsewhere. The galleries and programmes give access to more than 5 million visitors each year to new experiences in culture, the natural world and science.", "industry_forums": "", "head_office_phone": "(+44)2079425000", "level_of_interest": "global", "relevant_communication": "", "financial_year_end_date": "01/03/2018", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "10000-24999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "97140021", "legal_status": "Non-Departmental Public Body", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Neil Greenwood", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "Head, Finance and Corporate Services"}
