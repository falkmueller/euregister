These special assets are called global commons, because they need worldwide cooperation for their sustainable use. To achieve that, a farsighted and international view is needed, which governments and other stakeholders often lack. MCC aims to fill this gap and provides policy advice as well as research on long-term, global issues such as climate change: In this area we explore solutions, foster public debates, and support a broad societal exploration of development alternatives. \n \nMCC was founded in 2012 by Stiftung Mercator and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK). At the end of its inception phase, which ran from 2012 to 2015, MCC supported 28 full-time-equivalent positions, distributed across 47 total staff members. Our research is carried out in seven working groups and one special task force. \n \nOur Vision \nWe envision a world of deliberative democracies that discuss openly and take well-informed decisions for the sustainable management of global commons. This ensures that current and future generations are provided with equitable access to the global commons. \n \nOur Mission \nMCC\u2019s mission is to provide solution-oriented policy pathways for governing the global commons to enhance sustainable development and human well-being. Our approach is based on high-quality research to inform policy making in an iterative societal learning process. We call this assessment-making.", "industry_forums": "", "inter_groups": "", "number_of_persons_involved": "6", "relevant_communication": "Ver\u00f6ffentlichungen: \nhttp://www.mcc-berlin.net/forschung/publikationen.html \n \nEvents: \nhttp://www.mcc-berlin.net/events/zurueckliegend.html \n \nPresse: \nhttp://www.mcc-berlin.net/media/presseinformationen.html \nhttp://www.mcc-berlin.net/media/in-den-medien.html", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2017", "lat": 52.4817514, "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "100000-199999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "1970000", "legal_status": "gGmbH", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Ottmar Edenhofer", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "Director", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+49)030 3385537 0"}
