In the coming decades, issues related to international trade in services will present challenges to the multilateral trading system that at least equal, in importance and difficulty, tariff and non-tariff barriers to the development of trade in goods. \n \n2.    While bilateral and regional agreements and initiatives can play a useful supportive role, a firm and widely supported multilateral agreement remains the ultimate goal of services negotiations within the WTO. \n \n3.    Services and other services-related issues (such as investment and public procurement) should be negotiated in all international trade negotiations, with as much emphasis that the one given to trade in goods. \n \n4.    International trade in services negotiations should create much improved opportunities for profitable international business.  To that end, they should:  \n\u2022    be ambitious in their goals for real liberalisation, \n\u2022    achieve a broad and deep coverage of services sectors in WTO members and acceding countries, as well as in regional and bilateral trading partners involved in trade negotiations, \n\u2022    obtain the widest possible standstill commitments starting at the beginning of each new negotiations,  \n\u2022    go well beyond these standstills, in order to remove or reduce as far as possible barriers to trade and investment in all services sectors. \n \nRemaining impediments to substantially full market access and national treatment should be liberalised progressively on an agreed transition schedule.  Particular attention should be paid to those services where, not enough progress has been made since the conclusion of the Uruguay Round signed in Marrakech in 1994. \n \n5.    The cross-border delivery of services in electronic form is of growing importance for many services sectors. Therefore, specific attention needs to be paid in the international trade in services negotiations to improving commitments which facilitate that mode of supply for all services sectors.   \n \n6.    International trade in services negotiations should achieve greater liberalisation in all four modes of supply of services: cross-border supply, consumption abroad, commercial presence and presence of natural persons.   \n \n7.    Close monitoring of countries' ratification and implementation at all relevant part of trade agreements should be conducted. \n \n8.    Countries acceding to the WTO must make strong and comprehensive commitments to services liberalisation as part of their accession process. \n \n9.    Among the goals which should be reflected in the commitments made in national schedules the following are of major importance: \n \na)    The right to establish and operate competitively; \nb)    Foreign investors should have the same access to domestic markets as domestic companies; \nc)    Freedom to provide cross-border services in highly international-oriented sectors; \nd)    Removal of barriers (nationality, residence requirements, etc.) to the posting of key personnel; \ne)    Exceptions to commitments should be precise, transparent, temporary and limited to the minimum required for their purpose; \nf)    Existing investments should be grandfathered; \n \n10.    Pro-competitive principles to rule-making should be developed, while preserving appropriate regulatory frameworks.  \n \n11.    Political and public support for trade liberalisation in services sectors will require greater understanding of the benefits of trade liberalisation and the negotiating processes by which liberalisation is achieved.", "industry_forums": "", "head_office_phone": "(+322)2307514", "level_of_interest": "European, global", "relevant_communication": "Our position papers, press releases and other reports are published on our website: \nhttp://www.esf.be/new/", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2017", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "200000-299999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "0", "legal_status": "Non for profit organisation - No legal status", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Pascal KERNEIS", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "Managing Director"}
