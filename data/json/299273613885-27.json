Quality of life embraces not just material well-being, but freedom of choice to engage in the arts, culture and all aspects of civic life. This vision applies in the context of Ireland, Europe and the wider world and challenges the existing economic order. \n \nCongress Mission \n \nCongress will strive to achieve economic development, social cohesion and justice by upholding the values of solidarity, fairness and equality. \n \nThe primary instrument for the achievement of this mission will be the organisation of workers in unions. Congress will also construct and advocate for a platform of policies capable of delivering our vision of a just society. We will engage with Government, employers, civil society organisations, voluntary groups and international bodies to promote its attainment. We will support unions in their efforts to secure a fairer distribution of the wealth their members create.", "industry_forums": "", "head_office_phone": "(+353)8997777", "level_of_interest": "European, national, regional/local", "relevant_communication": "", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2016", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "4000000-4249999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "3945512", "legal_status": "Friendly Society", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Patricia King", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "General Secretary"}
