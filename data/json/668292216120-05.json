Together, our SMEs constitute a dedicated supply chain, which ensures the competitiveness and dynamism of the automotive industry sector as a whole. Our members are an integral part of the European economy. The independent aftermarket value chain ensures lasting innovation and effective competition which provides European motorists with the freedom of choice in the aftermarket care of their vehicles.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+32)27619510"}
