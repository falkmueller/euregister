High quality research and analysis, with an increased focus on applied research and policy, continue to be the Centre\u2019s core activities. This research and analysis informs and supports the Centre\u2019s advocacy for and promotion of cross-border cooperation on the island of Ireland and increasingly, our work in an EU and broader international context. The ability to provide independent, evidence-based information and analysis is fundamental to the Centre\u2019s role as an essential resource for policy and decision-makers and cross-border practitioners. \n \nThe Centre has an established itinerary of conferences, seminars and lectures on public policy issues (including an annual policy seminar in Brussels), publishes The Journal of Cross Border Studies in Ireland annually, and also publishes briefing papers, research reports and submissions to public policy consultations. These are all available on the Centre\u2019s website (www.crossborder.ie).  \n \nThe Centre also maintains a separate website, www.borderpeople.info as part of the Border People project \u2013 a source of information, capacity building and analysis of issues related to cross-border mobility.", "financial_year_end_date": "01/07/2016", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "200000-299999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "271421", "legal_status": "charity", "procurement": "", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "goals__remit": "The Centre for Cross Border Studies (CCBS), based in Armagh, has a specific and unique role in contributing to the increased social, economic and territorial cohesion of the island of Ireland through: \n \n\u2022    addressing information gaps and other barriers that constrain cross-border mobility and cross-border cooperation through research and provision of resources, tools and other practical support; \n \n\u2022    promoting and improving the quality of Cross-Border Cooperation between public bodies, and between public bodies, business and civil society; and \n \n\u2022    improving the capacity of people involved in social and economic development of the island to engage in mutually beneficial Cross-Border Cooperation.  \n \nThe Centre also provides secretariat services for two important cross-border networks: Universities Ireland and the Standing Conference on Teacher Education, North and South.  \n \nThe context for Cross-Border Cooperation on the island of Ireland has evolved and deepened since the 1998 Belfast/Good Friday Agreement that embeds a policy imperative for cooperation and established an architecture of cross-border structures. EU Cohesion Policy has provided the second pillar upon which cross-border cooperation has developed \u2013 and these two pillars comprise the policy framework within which the Centre has operated in recent years. The June 2016 Referendum on the UK\u2019s Withdrawal from the EU has, however, significantly altered the policy environment in which the Centre is active.   \n \nThe Centre is an independent company limited by guarantee (UK charity no.
