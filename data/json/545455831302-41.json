We have the core purpose of delivering sustainable and inclusive economic growth throughout Scotland.  \n  \nAs a Non Departmental Public Body, we have a crucial role to playing in helping deliver the Scottish Government\u2019s purpose of creating a more successful country, with opportunities for all of Scotland to flourish, through increasing sustainable economic growth.  \n  \nTourism is a key component of Scotland\u2019s economy as demonstrated by its status as one of Scotland\u2019s Growth Sectors . Growth in the sector in recent years, both in terms of value and jobs, has cemented the sector\u2019s status as a key contributor to economic growth:  \n \nbetween 2008 and 2014, tourism GVA grew by 42%, while tourism employment increased in 2015 by 11% to reach 217,000 (9% of employment), the highest level of employment in tourism since the Business Register and Employment Survey began. In 2015, Scotland attracted approximately 14.9 million overnight visitors, which generated \u00a35 billion in visitor expenditure. Further to this 124 million day trips were taken in Scotland with a total spend of \u00a33.9 billion. Taking into account the wider Scottish supply chain, spending by tourists in Scotland generates \u00a311 billion of economic activity in the wider Scottish supply chain and contributes \u00a36 billion to Scottish GDP. \n  \nTo deliver our vision and our core purpose, VisitScotland adopts the following strategies: \n  \n\u2022    Marketing: we will drive advocacy by inspiring a national movement, helping to facilitate this global advocacy with quality information, content and advice, and empowering and enabling the Scottish tourism industry, in particular our large SME base, to seize the opportunities that the digital economy presents.  \n \n\u2022    Events: we will support the delivery of the national events strategy, Scotland the Perfect Stage, working with partners to sustain, develop and promote Scotland\u2019s international profile as one of the world\u2019s foremost public-facing events destinations and as the perfect stage for events.  \n \n\u2022    Quality & Sustainability: we will promote and facilitate the continuous improvement of total quality of the visitor experience in Scotland, building on the strong foundation and economic impact delivered to date by the Quality Assurance Schemes and ensuring that a sustainable approach is taken to developing the industry. \n \n\u2022    Inclusive Tourism: we will strive to make tourism in Scotland inclusive and available to all, engaging with and listening to our partners and stakeholders to ensure that every corner of Scotland benefits from tourism.  \n \n\u2022    International Engagement: we will work across a wide range of audiences, including other Team Scotland Partners such as Scottish Government, SDI and VisitBritain; the international travel trade; Associations; other National Tourism Organisations; and academia, alumni and Diaspora networks to better understand international opportunities and optimise the potential that increased internationalisation of the tourism industry represents. \n  \nTourism is more than a holiday experience. It creates jobs and sustains communities in every corner of Scotland and is at the heart of the Scottish Economy. Tourism acts as a showcase for Scotland, encouraging investment not only in the tourism sector itself, but, through the influence of business events, in a wide range of sectors, ranging from life sciences to the creative industries.", "industry_forums": "", "inter_groups": "", "number_of_persons_involved": "1", "relevant_communication": "As above.", "financial_year_end_date": "01/03/2018", "lat": 55.9814027, "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "0-9999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "45000000", "legal_status": "Non Departmental Public Body", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Lee McRonald", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "International Partnerships Manager", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+44)1314722222"}
