Since 1979 Forest has been the leading voice defending tolerant non-smokers and adults who choose to smoke and don\u2019t want to quit. Our core message is that adults who are aware of the health risks should be able to choose to consume a legal product without excessive regulation. Forest EU advocates for respectful policy measures that protect individual freedom and personal responsibility. Forest EU is supported by the Confederation of European Community Cigarette Manufacturers (CECCM) whose members are Japan Tobacco International (JTI), British American Tobacco (BAT) and Imperial Brands PLC (IMB), and by the members* of the European Smoking Tobacco Association (ESTA). Our annual budget in 2018 is \u20ac165,000. Forest EU has an independent organizational structure and advocates for the consumer, not the tobacco industry. Forest EU accepts there are serious health risks associated with smoking tobacco and does not, through its campaigning activities, seek to promote or encourage it.
