JEF is convinced that a federal Europe on the basis of democracy and subsidiarity should be established. JEF is a supranational, politically pluralist youth NGO with about 30,000 members in over 30 European countries. JEF Netherlands is a member section of JEF Europe which currently has 120 members. The goal of JEF is the creation of a democratic European federation as a guarantee for peace and a more free, just and democratic society. JEF fosters European citizenship, works for the widening and deepening of the EU and aims at bringing Europe closer to the citizens. Our ideas are spread through international activities and youth exchanges, publications, public actions and co-operation with other youth organisations. \n  \nWe work in close cooperation with our pan European mother organisations, the Union of European Federalists (UEF) and the Young European Federalists Europe (JEF). Through the cross border network, we have established a permanent institutional framework for cooperation and joint actions together with our sister sections in Belgium, France, the UK, Luxembourg and Germany. \n  \nOne of our key fields of action is the organization of street actions such as demonstrations. For example, in May 2015 we organised a counter demonstration to the anti EU demonstration in Maastricht. In November 2015 we are co-organisers of a pro refugee demonstration which is going to take place in Maastricht on Saturday the 28th. \n  \nSecond, we through our blog, resolutions, policy papers and public debates we conduct policy work on issues of European relevance. For example, on our homepage you can find a resolution on the refugee crisis in Europe and a blog post about the new top candidate of the UK labour party. Materials about or position on EU foreign policy, trade and security and defence policy are in a draft stage and will be published soon.   \n \n \n \nWhat are the activities and experience of the organization in the areas relevant for this application? \nIn April 2014 JEF-NL hosted a debate with MEP Ska Keller, following the \u201cFirst European Presidential Debate\u201d at Maastricht University. More than 50 people attended the event. After a brief speech by Keller, the audience engaged in an intense debate with the politician. \n  \nIn October 2015 JEF-NL co-organized a joint political commission meeting on migration policy of UEF and JEF Europe, which took place in Maastricht. During the event, which took place from Friday to Sunday, 30 political commission members of UEF and JEF listened to speeches by renowned experts on EU migration policy, engaged in debates and drafted policy position papers. \n \nAlso in October 2015 JEF-NL co-organized a training weekend for JEFers form the Netherlands and Belgium. In the course of three days 30 participating JEFers were trained in the key principles of project management, communication and team building.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+31)655797245"}
