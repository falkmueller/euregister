Our aim is to communicate and connect, to build bridges between citizens and use their potential to build the future. \n \nToo many non-profit organisations exist in and around the Brussels bubble that all share the same or similar goals. Yet, instead of working together, most organisations only think of expanding their own influence and instead compete with others, despite there being very little funding for this kind of effort. Furthermore, these organisations damage each other\u2019s ability to be heard and influence policy makers and other relevant stakeholders, by dividing their forces. \nWe want to put a stop to this practice and unite all organisations. But unlike some organisations that have tried to do so in the past, our goal is not a merger or a centralised committee to rule them all, but a network of equals that works together when and where their goals aline. \n \nThe EFF is present in many different countries and locations. In each city and region we are active, our local teams create their own community projects, based on the needs and possibilities in their area. These projects are geared towards at least one or multiple of our main goals and can be both short lived and long-term in nature. Successful projects may also be extended across borders, scaling up in size as demand and capacity grow. Cross-border projects may also happen outright were feasible and logical.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+43)6606558998"}
