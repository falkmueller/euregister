EU Menu-Food Consumption Study of Adults in Croatia 2011-2012 \nTo determine dietary habits of the general adult population, HAH conducted National Food Consumption Survey in Croatia. The survey was conducted in the adult population (18\u201364 years) in two repetitions (1st part in autumn 2011, 2nd part in summer 2012, to cover seasonal variations) on a representative sample of 2002 respondents. Study participants were grouped based on the geographical location in 6 regions and covered different socio-demographic parameters (regional coverage, rural-urban environment, education, monthly income, employment and family status, level of physical activity, body weight and height). For each consumed food, participants were asked to indicate the frequency of consumption, with classification from several times a day to once a year (divided to 10 levels). The national manual with different food quantity was used to help participants to specify the amount of the consumed food. The household measurement and then weighing of particular food were used for food that was not included in the manual. All participants were also asked to describe food and drink they consumed (place of consumption, where the food was bought, way of preparation, brand and origin of food) in order to help to specifically identify food and drinks in classification. \n \n3. EU Menu \u2013 The first Croatian study of food consumption of infants and young children 2017-2021 \nHAH in cooperation with partners (Faculty of Food Technology and Biotechnology in Zagreb, Faculty of Food Technology in Osijek and Croatian Institute for Public Health) is conducting the first national study on nutritional habits of infants, young children and children up to 9 years of age. The project is funded by EFSA mounting 1.160.000,00 HRK. The research began in 01/2017 and will last for 54 months, and will be based on the EU Menu Methodology for Collecting Food Information on Individual Levels. A total of at least 1820 respondents, including an ad hoc group of infants, will be included. In the first two years, on-line data collection software will be developed, which will include all relevant databases, including recipes, brands, food composition, and image of food portions adjusted to age subgroups. Collected data, except for risk / exposure assessment, can be used as a basis for nutrition planning, assessment of population health status, trends and habits regarding food consumption, lifestyle, in physical activity and will be available to the academic community, industry and consumers. \n4.
