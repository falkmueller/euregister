For this reason, ETPLAS was established as an information portal to enable information sharing and communication between training providers, approval/accrediting bodies, employers and MS authorities. The Steering committee of ETPLAS is composed of representatives from all these groups and is supported by the National Contact Points and a Reference Group representing various stakeholder and territorial interests.  \n \nETPLAS shares information on courses in laboratory animal science. The course list aims to assist individuals looking for courses within the EU to find available courses and programmes and to help Member States to develop mutual recognition of training. \n \nETPLAS will also: \n- Publish agreed key factors and information requirements for mutual recognition of LAS education and training courses. \n- Establish a database with information on training courses and accrediting bodies together with their contact details \n- Provide a central hub of information relating to key topics in education and training  \n- Supply training providers with the necessary information to establish additional training courses across the EU. \n- Provide a mechanism to identify suitable training materials and existing courses for CPD", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2017", "lat": 52.35572, "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "877", "legal_status": "none", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "David Smith", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "Chair", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+44)1133436010"}
