The Internet Society was founded in 1992 by the \u201cfathers of the Internet\u201d, Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn. For more than 20 years now, the Internet Society has supported the development of fundamental Internet technology, and promoted transparency and a multistakeholder, bottom-up approach in addressing global Internet governance issues.  \n \nTo help achieve our mission, we work on championing public policies that enable open access; facilitating the open development of standards, protocols, and the technical infrastructure of the Internet; and supporting capacity building and access to the Internet in developing countries. A primary focus of our public policy work is Internet governance, but we also work on other policy issues related to the openness of the Internet. Regarding open standards, we work to facilitate the smooth operation of and growing participation in Internet standards through the Internet Engineering Taskforce (IETF), an organised activity of the Internet Society. We also run several programmes on technical capacity building and Internet leadership especially in the developing world. \n \nThe Internet Society is a global organisation with main offices located in Reston, Virginia, USA and in Geneva, Switzerland. Our regional presence is steered by our six Regional Bureaus \u2013 Africa, Asia-Pacific, Europe, Latin America and Caribbean, Middle-East and North America. Our Chapters, Members, and other community partners drive most of our local engagements and activities at national level.", "belgium_office_city": "Brussels", "head_office_phone": "(+1)7034392120"}
