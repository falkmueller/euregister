It believes that existing laws should be enforced to prevent anticompetitive behaviour that harms consumers and to prevent new regulations from stifling innovation. It calls for two essential principles to be consistently applied: \n \n1.    Transparency \nConsumers \u2013 not search engines \u2013 should choose winners in the marketplace. Competition in the search marketplace benefits consumers through increased choice, innovation to improve products, and the transparent display of search results. When search providers discriminate by manipulating results in order to promote a favoured product and demote competitors, consumers suffer. \n \n2.    Innovation \nConsumers also benefit when a competitive market forces search providers to continue innovating and develop the best solutions for online search. No one company should be allowed to use its dominance to foreclose competitors from the search marketplace \u2013 particularly in high-traffic specialty segments such as travel, jobs, health, real estate, media and local search.", "industry_forums": "", "head_office_phone": "(+32)02 533 5911", "level_of_interest": "European, global, national", "relevant_communication": "", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2017", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "50000-99999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "0", "legal_status": "FairSearch is an international non-profit association incorporated under Belgian Law.
