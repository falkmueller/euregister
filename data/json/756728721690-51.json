DIGITAL SINGLE MARKET \nThe internet and digital technologies are transforming our world. But existing barriers online mean citizens miss out on goods and services, internet companies and start-ups have their horizons limited, and businesses and governments cannot fully benefit from digital tools. In particular, we aim to follow the progresses about the topic \u201cskills\u201d in the third pillar \u201cEconomy & Society\u201d; \n2.    JOBS, GROWTH AND INVESTMENTS \nSince the global economic and financial crisis, the EU has been suffering from low levels of investment. Collective and coordinated efforts at European level are needed to put Europe on the path of economic recovery. The Investment Plan for Europe has the potential to bring investments back in line with its historical trends. In addition, structural reforms will nurture the economic recovery and can provide further bases for sustainable growth. In this, we believe a strong factor of success is plaid by the digital education which needs infrastructural investments and actual interventions directed to the citizens; \n3.    EDUCATION, CULTURE, YOUTH, LANGUAGES, AND SPORT \nAll these domains are the core ones for our activities and interests.
