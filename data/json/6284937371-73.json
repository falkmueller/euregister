IC engines are at the heart of modern societies. \n \nEUROMOT was founded in 1991. For more than 20 years our association has been promoting engines in society. We have been supporting our members - the leading manufacturers of internal combustion engines in Europe, USA and Japan - by providing expertise and up-to-date information and by campaigning on their behalf for internationally aligned legislation. \n \nThe EUROMOT member companies employ all over the world about 200,000 highly skilled and motivated men and women.
