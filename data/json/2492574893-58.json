EuDA members employ approximately 25,000 European employees directly \u201con land and on board of the vessels\u201d and more than 48,300 people indirectly (through the suppliers and services companies). The combined fleet of EuDA\u2019s members counts approximately 750 seaworthy EU-flagged vessels. \n \nDredging activities are not well known by the larger public, but as a matter of fact, the European dredging companies, members of EuDA, are world market leaders with about 80% share of the worldwide open dredging market and a turnover of 9.2bn Euro in 2015. Although 70% of operations take place outside Europe, 90% of the returns flow back to Europe. \n \nThe Association serves its members in all kinds of requests related to dredging issues, presently strongly emphasising Social and Environmental affairs. These issues are coordinated by the Secretariat and executed by its specialised working groups composed of experts from the member companies.  \n \nThe Association will pursue its goals by endorsing policies to create fair and equitable conditions for competition; commits to respecting applicable national, European and international rules and regulations; commits to operating its fleet safely, effectively and responsibly.", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+32)2 646 81 83"}
