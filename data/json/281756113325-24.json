It employs around 5000 scientists whose work is recognized internationally not only for their contribution to various Italian and European laboratories, but also to numerous research centers worldwide. \nIt conducts theoretical and experimental research in the fields of subnuclear, nuclear and astroparticle physics. All of the INFN\u2019s research activities are undertaken within a framework of international competition, in close collaboration with Italian universities on the basis of solid academic partnerships spanning decades. Fundamental research in these areas requires the use of cutting-edge technology and instruments, developed by the INFN at its own laboratories and in collaboration with industries.The technology and expertise developed by the INFN in conducting its experiments also has major implications for the medical and healthcare industry and for the technology sector in general. It also uses its own analysis and research instruments and facilities to addresses issues regarding the cultural and environmental heritage. The INFN is also a leading national and international player in the GRID, supercomputing network project and in expanding its use to applications in other scientific fields, e-commerce and culture. \nThe Institute has a positive impact on the Italian economy, through its close collaboration with high-tech companies, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). It participates with them in joint initiatives for Italian projects but, above all, in major international ventures.  \nIn addition, the INFN is fully committed to promoting scientific culture.It takes part in all the main dissemination activities in Italy and each year it organises various exhibitions and events throughout the country, some of which are broadcast on TV.", "industry_forums": "", "head_office_phone": "(+39)066840031", "level_of_interest": "national", "relevant_communication": "", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2016", "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "50000-99999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "397032955", "legal_status": "Research Performing Organization", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Alessia D'Orazio", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "INFN Delegate to European Institutions"}
