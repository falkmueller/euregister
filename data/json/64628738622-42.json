This organisation is critical with the present society model and believes that important changes in the production and consumption patterns should be faced, in order to avoid an ecological crisis. \n \nThe type of work is quite reactive, and ranges from direct action, to educative programs, or to reporting of alternative solutions. This organisation also works though legal actions against detected infrindgements. Ecologistas en Acci\u00f3n sets up its activity mainly through the voluntary work of many people. This organisation is independent from any political party, administration or private corporation. At the present moment several campaigns are taking place on very varied issues like air pollution, genetically modified foods, climate change, forest fires, urbanism,... One of their areas of interest is the marine environment.\u00a0 Through awareness campaigns, Ecologistas promotes sustainable exploitation of the marine environment and reports episodes of marine pollution.\u00a0\u00a0", "industry_forums": "", "inter_groups": "", "number_of_persons_involved": "4", "relevant_communication": "", "financial_year_end_date": "01/12/2017", "lat": 40.4221945, "estimate_of_costs_as_a_range": "900000-999999", "overall_budget_turnover_absolute_amount": "1648606", "legal_status": "Association", "person_in_charge_of_eu_relations": "Samuel Martin-Sosa", "customers": "", "belgium_office_post_box": "", "position": "International Coordinator", "belgium_office_city": "", "head_office_phone": "(+34)915312739"}
