The Committee has assigned for this purpose specifically a GI working group which is currently working on promoting the use of green infrastructure, specifically nature-based solutions to promote climate resilience in urban areas and providing ecological, economic and social benefits. \nIFLA Europe is a key beneficiary from having over 30 countries and 9500 members contributing with professional knowledge and actions in advancing GI on different levels of planning and design. Also individual national associations publish guidance and so BDLA, Landscape Institute and many others produce a body of work. \nAs the representative body, we benefit from this and our involvement in EKLIPSE will benefit likewise. \nExamples to the breadth of work produced include: \nCopenhagen's Large Scale Cloudburst Mitigation Plans \nRotterdam Climate Change Adaptation Strategy \nAnd The Urban Land Institutes \"Urban Resilience Program\"  \n  \n     \nIFLA Europe\u2019s Education Committee is in close collaboration with the Professional Practice Committee.
